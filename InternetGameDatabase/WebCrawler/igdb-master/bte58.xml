– John F. Kennedy</value><value>In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year  dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new "superpowers" scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.</value><value> inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics </value><value> and </value><value>. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?</value><value>Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.</value><value>A deluxe edition, published in 2009 includes the following changes from the basic game:</value><value>

During the game you will utilize orbital facilities and alien technology to build colony domes in strategic locations to control the newly discovered world.</value><value>The game board shows the planet, its moon, the stations in orbit around the planet, and the solar system’s star.

On a turn, the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order. Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl; in addition, if the colored pieces in that bowl match the colors shown on a Trajan tile next to the bowl (with tiles being placed at the start of the game and through later actions), then the player takes the additional action shown on that tile.</value><value>What are you trying to do with these actions?

At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty.

Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.</value><value>Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn.

Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal gameplay.

The compelling storyline spans more than 12 new locations, many from Episode III, including volcanic Mustafar and the space battle above Coruscant. All-new classic movie moments complete the Star Wars Battlefront II experience, as players battle within the interior of the Death Star and visit Princess Leia’s blockade runner, the Tantive IV, as seen at the beginning of Episode IV A New Hope. In addition, at certain key moments within the battles, players can feel the Force as a Jedi. For the first time ever, Star Wars Battlefront II players can engage in space combat and, during the same battle, board enemy ships to attack from within. Starting on foot inside a capital ship, players can enter the spacecraft of their choice and travel into space to dogfight with the rival faction. From there, they can dock within the enemy’s capital ship, overtake the ship’s command posts, man its turrets to disable its shields and destroy it from within! Or, they can simply stay inside their own capital ship and defend it from attacks and enemy fire. The choice is theirs. The stellar online play that marked the original Star Wars Battlefront returns even bigger and better for Star Wars Battlefront II. Players can locate their buddies and track their stats as they battle alongside more players than ever (up to 24 on PS2, 32 on Xbox, 64 on Windows).

The valkyrie Silmeria once served Odin loyally, but after an incident ignited a conflict between them, Odin forcefully reincarnated her as a human. The human soul that would carry her spirit was that of Alicia, Princess of Dipan. Ordinarily, Silmeria’s consciousness would have been sealed, her spirit dormant until she was next summoned... However, the forced transmigration causes Silmeria's spirit to awaken within Alicia, leaving two souls to inhabit a single body. The spirit that should have been sealed has awakened—a situation Odin will not ignore for long. This installment introduces the new Photon Action System to the classic side-scrolling action format found in the original. Projecting photons grants players more freedom to explore and expands the action, resulting in challenging puzzles with clever solutions. Add to that "sealstones" that affect the laws of nature in dungeons, launching strategy to new heights. The unique battle system of the previous game has evolved into the Advanced Tactical Combination Battle System.

As the prince, a player's duty is to clean up the King's mess and re-create the starry skies by rolling around the cleverly designed locations to collect objects and build up their 'katamari' -- a Japanese word for clump or large mass. The catch is that it's not the quality or the actual number of objects gathered that is most critical to the player's success, but instead the sheer size of the player's 'katamari' that is most important. Along the way, players can roll over hundreds of unusual objects of all sizes and shapes including cookies, cars, mermaids, planes, clouds and even people. The larger the player's 'katamari' grows, the more objects the player can amass along the way -- thus proving if you want to succeed in Katamari Damacy -- size does matter. Katamari Damacy features a single-player story mode and a two-player battle mode. The simple game play mechanics allow for optimal ball rolling and object collecting fun.

Archadia's invasion and the subsequent death of the Dalmascan king prompted the Princess Ashe, the sole surviving heir to the Dalmascan throne, to take up arms against the invaders. In her struggle to oust the occupying Archadian forces and restore freedom to her people, Ashe must watch as many of her allies pay the blood price for that freedom. Though tempted to abandon all hope in the face of the Empire's might, her determination keeps her from succumbing before what would seem to be inevitable defeat. Then she meets Vaan, an urchin from the Dalmascan capital of Rabanastre. Vaan dreams of one day becoming a sky pirate, escaping the Empire on his airship. Vaan, Ashe, Vaan's friend Penelo, the sky pirate Balthier, his partner Fran and many more are on an adventure through Ivalice that traces the mysteries behind the Archadian Empire's invasion. Bringing with it a wide array of new gameplay elements, Final Fantasy XII will change the way players think about the Final Fantasy series. Numerous possibilities abound within each scenario, allowing for a less linear, more unique experience for each player. The game also supports Dolby Pro Logic II both in-game and during movie sequences, immersing the player in the middle of the action.

But his journey did not end there. In God of War II, Kratos sits atop his Olympus throne, as the new God of War – far more ruthless than Ares ever was. To end his continued torment, Kratos must journey to the far reaches of the earth and defeat untold horrors and alter that which no mortal, or god has ever changed, his fate. God of War II sets an epic stage for a devastating mythological war to end all wars. In God of War II, players retake the role of Kratos. Armed with the deadly blades and blistering rage, players are aided by new breath-taking magic and new brutal combat moves. The journey takes them through vividly striking environments where they are faced with a labyrinth of challenging puzzles and mini-games intricately woven into the story. The violent world of Greek mythology comes to life in gory detail as Kratos encounters new mythical characters, and compete in epic boss battles in his quest.

Welcome to the 1980s. Having just made it back onto the streets of Liberty City after a long stretch in maximum security, Tommy Vercetti is sent to Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. They were understandably nervous about his re-appearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good idea. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He's set up and is left with no money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take over the city himself. Vice City offers vehicular pleasures to suit every taste. For the speed enthusiast, there's high-performance cars and motorbikes. For the sportsman, a powerboat or a golf buggy lets you enjoy the great outdoors. For those that need that sense of freedom and escape, why not charter a helicopter and see the beauty of Vice City from the air?

The year is 2219AD, and Earth's Star Federation has unleashed the R-GRAY advanced tactical combat fighter to save the planet from certain destruction at the hands of the bloodthirsty Secilia Federation. Despite impossible odds, you must now command a specially outfitted R-Gray fighter to defend Earth from certain destruction. Each fighter is equipped with lock-on lasters, pulse lasers, and a single devastating assault laser array that can destroy all sighted targets as once. Even with this technology at your disposal, the battle will not be easy.

Alongside you in the ranks is your best friend Jowy, a boy born of nobility but who has never been able to receive approval in his stubborn father's eyes. As the game begins, you are immediately tossed into a tale of political strife, betrayal and war on a grand scale beyond your scope in the early stages. As the game wears on, the plot will twist, turn and develop in numerous ways that expose the personalities of each of the characters involved. The battle system is turn-based, with the option to equip Runes for special abilities, combine party member attacks to create chain combos or devastating spells, and the option to run the battle in Auto mode.</value></description></item><item><rating><value>83</value></rating><name><value>Breath of Fire IV</value></name><images><value><url>http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/1af5f6dd04bd956a3a8737c187431af4-98.jpg</url><path>full/ea749ffb974059e8b08e7b74b6b39b702759b2a1.jpg</path><checksum>df7e5ef58a0db28644c556fcb5a20646</checksum></value></images><image_urls><value>http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/1af5f6dd04bd956a3a8737c187431af4-98.jpg</value></image_urls><platform><value>PlayStation</value></platform><num_of_players><value>1 Player</value></num_of_players><genre><value>Role-Playing</value></genre><description><value>After centuries of war, the two lands bordering an impenetrable swampland have finally reached an armistice.

In addition, a brand new battle system makes combat smooth and innovative by introducing an element field system and combo system that gives the player unparalleled flexibility in their fighting options. The elimination of random battles also quickens the pace of the game, and places the choice of where to battle in the player's hands. With character designs by a famed Japanese illustrator and music by the original Chrono Trigger composer, Chrono Cross features visuals and sounds that bring its magic to life.</value></description></item><item><rating><value>93</value></rating><name><value>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</value></name><images><value><url>http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/3e92e4b30a3157280918c473cf495f6d-98.jpg</url><path>full/9a082c176dd11d44af8a6a2480d44c2c0423b2ef.jpg</path><checksum>71d94578a7aa404f039d55f4e8863ea2</checksum></value></images><image_urls><value>http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/0/3e92e4b30a3157280918c473cf495f6d-98.jpg</value></image_urls><platform><value>PlayStation</value></platform><num_of_players><value>1 Player</value></num_of_players><genre><value>Action</value></genre><description><value>As a descendant of Dracula, you must end the vampire bloodline.

Passing has been refined for faster and more accurate execution, while improved pass targeting and AI logic will create more open spaces and generate greater scoring opportunities. Goalkeepers will be more responsive when positioning themselves for a save, while still allowing for juicy rebounds adding to the non-stop soccer theme.

Don't worry about moving around the court to get to the ball – the game automatically moves players into position. Baseball (1-2 players): Grip the controller like a bat and swat fastballs out of the park in a home run derby. Timing and bat speed will make all the difference between going yard and whiffing, so keep an eye on the ball and swing for the fences. In the two-player game, one player pitches and the other bats. Golf (1 player): Step up to the tee, hold the controller like a golf club and swing naturally to smack the ball onto the green. The harder players swing the club, the farther the ball will fly, so be sure to take some practice swings before going for the pin. After reaching the green, line up putts carefully, practice the stroke and try to hole out.

The goal of the game is to guide Donkey Kong through beautifully rendered stages like lava caves, tempestuous oceans and even a ninja-chimp fortress. Racing through the game will get players to the goal, but the real skill comes from helping Donkey Kong perform multiple mid-air acrobatic moves as he collects bananas in each stage. The more sweet moves he does in a row, the more bonus bananas he gets at the end of the stage.

Characters can be approached but offer different responses and be found in different places, while new clues and gameplay paths can be followed. The title follows Harry Mason, as he attempts to unravel the mystery of his missing daughter, Cheryl. A broken man, Mason’s investigations lead him to the mist-shrouded, snowy streets of Silent Hill: a malevolent town where the shadows play host to a wealth of evil, misshapen creatures. Designed to make full use of the Wii's unique controllers, Silent Hill: Shattered Memories uses the Wii Remote as a torch and cell phone as Mason looks for clues. The torch is vital for scouring the darkened, abandoned buildings of Silent Hill, while the phone acts as a secondary user interface, allowing the player to access maps via its GPS capabilities and take pictures of interesting elements. Likewise, the Wii Remote also can be used to pick up, examine and manipulate items to solve puzzles along the journey. Such technology was not available when the original Silent Hill was released in 1999, and its inclusion showcases Konami’s determination to enhance the playing experience with new, available technology. Also new to Shattered Memories is a psyche profile element, which monitors every aspect of player’s reactions - from where they explore first, items that have been examined, and their reaction to those they meet. Small visual elements will also be altered slightly, adding to the oppressing atmosphere where nothing is what it seems. The psyche profile will adapt Harry’s actions as and when he meets normal-looking people or the game's many inhuman denizens.

First, create a pair of Fallos inside your Wii Remote™ controller by shaking it up and down. Next, determine suitable places for the Fallos to land, then fling them to the selected cube with a swinging motion. After that, the Fallos are on their own. If your placement is sound, the Fallos will remain stable and you'll clear the stage after tossing a required number onto the cubes. But if the weight or locations of Fallos causes the cubes to tilt and sway too much, the Fallos will lose their balance and fall off. Adding to the challenge, you'll find that some cubes have different properties, making tosses tricky and further threatening the stability of the Fallos. Guide Fallos through dozens of single-player stages or invite family and friends to join you in two-player cooperative mode.

This sequel to the popular Wii Sports makes use of the Wii MotionPlus accessory, which gives players the most responsive and realistic experience possible. The Wii MotionPlus accessory, which is included with Wii Sports Resort, plugs into the base of the Wii Remote controller and, combined with the accelerometer and sensor bar, provides an experience that gives players an even greater sense of immersion. Just as with Wii Sports, people compete against friends and family. As the competition heats up, Wii Sports Resort is as much fun to watch as it is to play. First-time players should find it easy to pick up a Wii Remote and jump into the action. Wii Sports Resort takes place on a tropical island. A wide range of activities keep players coming back for one more round. Some sample activities include Sword Play, Power Cruising (racing a water scooter) and Disc Dog, which involves accurately tossing a disc to a cute, Mii-like dog.

But this culture is threatened; Tokogawa’s thirst for power leads to a conflict over the enormously powerful, though cursed, Demon Blades. Used in hatred, drenched in blood, the cursed blades condemn those who use them to tragedy, madness, and untimely deaths. As chaos spreads, denizens from the netherworld breach their realm as these malevolent swords summon evil spirits - and the Dragon and Demon Gods as well. Featuring hand-drawn 2D art reflecting the heritage and tone of the storyline, Muramasa: The Demon Blade transports players into a little known mythology, envisioned by the creators of the critically acclaimed Odin Sphere. Players take on the role of a male ninja or female kunoichi, utilizing their ninja prowess to traverse the clever side-scrolling levels that feature vertical progression as well as the traditional horizontal stage advancement.

In MadWorld, Varrigan City is under siege by a terrorist group simply known as "The Organizers." They have isolated its citizens from the rest of the world, and have turned the city into a bizarre and twisted game show environment called "Death Watch." In this game of survival, all the citizens have become reluctant contestants and they are pitted against unknown enemies in the ultimate battle of life or death, where only the strongest will prevail. As Jack, players make their way through the various levels and environments in Varrigan City, crafting clever traps and using various weapons – chainsaws, street signs, and daggers, to name a few – to destroy enemies who threaten their lives. The Wii Remote and Nunchuk are used in a variety of motions that mimic the action on screen. Lively sports commentators call out moves as players execute them, and darkly comical finishing moves add a level of irreverence that contributes to the game's unique tone. Along with the exaggerated characters, upbeat pace and bloody visuals that define "Death Watch," a variety of crazed mini-games called "Blood Bath Challenges" are scattered among the levels, giving players a chance to upgrade weapons and increase overall scores.

The Leech Bots are the machines/creatures that extract color from the city and carry this "liquid color" inside them. To restore color to the city de Blob crushes the Leech Bots, absorbs the pigment they carry, and uses the pigment/paint to color everything it touches. de Blob is forced to take on the evil INKT Corporation agents who want the world devoid of color because "color is a crime!" Constantly under attack, the Blob in his own quirky way fights back. Rolling, bouncing and crushing are his weapons. The object is to color and/or stencil as many buildings in the city as possible while avoiding the enemy. Race against time moving at Blob speed, or choose your own pace. The city is a canvas and de Blob is your paint brush! Vast cityscapes and urban sprawl offers players the freedom to explore and make their own game-experience. Complete levels as a fun, animated superhero who transforms a hostile city into a vibrant, colorful, happy place. Creative activities and puzzles give immediate and continuous rewards throughout the entire city. Multiple challenges must be found and accepted, which can guide the player through to the next level – the destination and objective for one challenge can be the starting point of the next. Successful completion of challenges earns rewards such as points, time, environmental improvements, additional challenges, and liberating zones.

From the early touring days in 1963 Liverpool to the immortal, final performance on the Apple Corps rooftop, fans can follow in the band’s footsteps as they traverse the globe during the height of Beatlemania. Adding to the experience is the introduction of three-part vocal harmonies to game play, allowing gamers to revel in the unparalleled vocal stylings of the Fab Four. Beatles fans will also be thrilled to hear previously unreleased authentic voice recordings from John, Paul, George and Ringo chatting between takes during studio sessions recorded at Abbey Road more than four decades ago. The game begins during the band's earliest days at The Cavern Club in Liverpool, England. Gamers then travel across the Atlantic to experience the band's unforgettable 1964 performance on The Ed Sullivan Show, the sold-out concert at New York’s Shea Stadium in 1965, and conclude at The Beatles’ memorable concert at Budokan in Tokyo, Japan in 1966. The Beatles' studio years come to life in legendary Studio 2 at Abbey Road Studios. Highlighting the studio years are inspired artistic visual expressions known as Dreamscapes, intended to transport players to imaginative environments that capture the essence of The Beatles’ genre-busting musical and fashion transformations during their later years. The game follows The Beatles to 1969 where story mode culminates with their final performance on the rooftop of the Apple Corps Headquarters. The Beatles: Rock Band offers a new set of hardware representing the instruments made famous by John, Paul, George and Ringo. Featured in the set are the Rickenbacker 325 and Gretsch Duo Jet guitars - hailed as two of the celebrated, signature instruments played by John Lennon and George Harrison throughout their careers. Also included is a Höfner bass controller - a large-scale version of the bass famously used by Sir Paul McCartney. Rounding out the set is a Ringo Starr inspired, Ludwig-branded Rock Band 2 drum set with a classic pearl finish and vintage remake of a Beatles kick drum head.

It explains how the diabolical Emperor Geldoblame rose to power, and it also fills in many details about the heroes from the first title. In addition, players will learn about the origins of the world itself and why the Lost Ocean is returning. The hero, a blue-haired young man named Sagi, was sent to assassinate the Emperor but found the job had been done for him. Blamed for the death, he's now on the run with two friends - a robot named Guillo and a young woman named Milly. In the initial stages, the player's party will progress in a linear fashion, moving from one area to the next along a set path. After playing the game for a few hours, players will acquire a ship that lets them visit areas in the order of their choosing, allowing them to either pursue optional side quests or blast through the main mission as they see fit. Unlike traditional RPGs, where characters gain levels in categories such as strength and agility, the majority of leveling-up occurs by procuring better Magnus cards. There are more than 600 different Magnus cards in Baten Kaitos Origins, some of which have truly fantastical properties. Players can acquire cards in many different ways, including trading, buying, winning as spoils of war or by creating them themselves.</value></description></item><item><rating><value>75</value></rating><name><value>Madden NFL 08</value></name><images><value><url>http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/56cdc8ac41f3cec1cdd29d7a9cfcefcb-98.jpg</url><path>full/9e33169506206cabf6a38dffc1487a8200e4655b.jpg</path><checksum>89068a2b5695921b6d2d31dddaf7e30f</checksum></value></images><image_urls><value>http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/6/56cdc8ac41f3cec1cdd29d7a9cfcefcb-98.jpg</value></image_urls><platform><value>GameCube</value></platform><num_of_players><value>2  Online</value></num_of_players><genre><value>Sports</value></genre><description><value>Feel what it's like to be a field general making key personnel decisions on both sides of the ball during the game's biggest moments in Madden NFL 08.

His studies evaluated the impact of performing certain reading and mathematic exercises to help stimulate the brain. Brain Age presents quick mental activities that help keep your DS brain in shape. Activities include quickly solving simple math problems, counting people going in and out of a house simultaneously, drawing pictures on the Touch Screen, reading classic literature out loud, and more. You can also play sudoku, the number puzzle game which has become an extremely popular feature in U.S. newspapers. On your first day of exercise, you will take a series of tests and get a score that determines how old your brain is. This number is called your "DS Brain Age".

Packed with the most powerful race cars - new and classic, circuit and drift - players compete to conquer the most prestigious official race tracks and championships then beyond to compete in challenging city-based competitions, and then on through to road events and urban street races. The drama, the rivalries, the aggression and the crashes; this is not a game about collecting cars or spending all of your time in the front-end tuning suspension settings or designing liveries. Codemasters wants to make racing exciting again. Gamers compete on Europe's greatest official race tracks in prestige Marques including Aston Martin, Koenigsegg and Pagani. Iconic cities across the U.S, including San Francisco, Washington DC and Detroit - each with their own atmosphere and events - play host to diverse street races, where high-performance V8 muscle cars set the pace in aggressive, closely fought pack competitions. And in the Far East, Japanese racing culture sets the tone where night races, including Drift racing, takes drivers through neon illuminated cities and to outlying mountain roads. There's also the opportunity to compete in races that operate on the fringes of legality in the back streets and industrial areas of Yokohama.

Numbers at the head of the puzzles' columns and rows signify how the grids need to be filled out, but it will take a sharp mind to figure out the solution - and some speedy fingers to defeat the competition. The game's main Picross Mode offers a staggering 300 puzzles available to play at your leisure. Ranging from the elementary five by five grids to highly complicated twenty by twenty grids, this mode can keep even the most hardened gamers happy. Those less certain of their skills can opt to receive clues to help finish puzzles, or get a head start with a roulette-style hint function that reveals one line of the puzzle. Bring your individual talents to the table with My Picross Mode, in which you can create your very own puzzles to share with your friends (locally, or via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection). Designing your own puzzles is simplicity itself thanks to the easy-to-use stylus and Touch Screen. For that extra personal flair, you can even design the image beneath the puzzle which is revealed upon completion. A variety of unlockable skins - with themes ranging from nature to sports or video game heroes – give you all the customisation tools you’ll need to make Picross DS fit your style.

Before long, the game was shelved and drifted, unnoticed, into the annals of gaming history. Dark Void became a legendary "lost project" at Capcom. Now, nearly 20 years later, Dark Void is back! To commemorate the game's humble origins, Capcom has commissioned this recreation of the original 8-bit classic, now re-titled Dark Void Zero, on the Nintendo DSi system.

Using the stylus to control Kirby's movements is surprisingly intuitive, and the new control scheme provides many unique gameplay challenges. The rainbow paths you draw guide Kirby through the game, but they also can protect Kirby from falling icicles, lasers, cannon blasts and other hazards. In addition to drawing paths, the stylus can also be used to stun enemies, destroy barriers, detonate bombs and much more. Each of the game's seven worlds is divided into three stages, and each stage holds three hidden medals. Some are easy to find, while others are either well-hidden or heavily protected. You don't need to find these medals to complete the game, but the medals you recover can be traded in to unlock special features like new ink colors for the paths you draw with the stylus.

The game provides players with a new story, more puzzles and even a new mode of transportation. In this game, Link voyages by train, which offers up new possibilities for problem-solving. The game has the same look and feel established in Phantom Hourglass. Link has a valuable new companion. While navigating dungeons, he's accompanied by a Phantom, a hulking suit of armor that responds to his commands. Players can tap the Phantom to take command of him, then draw a line on the touch screen to direct him where to go. The stout Phantom can walk through fire or lava, be used as a platform to carry Link above dangers, or even run interference to block Link from harm. When Link conducts the train, players enjoy a satisfying combination of action and real-time puzzle solving as they determine which track to take and how to best manipulate their speed. When on the train, Link must plot the best route to the end of the line around ever-moving obstacles. While en route, Link might need to fire an onboard cannon at enemies who attack the train or sound the whistle to scare animals off the tracks. Link uses a variety of new items and weapons, including the Whirlwind, which players activate by blowing into the microphone of the Nintendo DS system. As with The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, players can draw notes on the in-game maps using the stylus on the touch screen.

Well, all these guys DO is jam! Prepare to rock as these beat masters use their groovy moves to save the day. As the music plays, players tap the screen, trace rhythmic patterns and keep the beat as the story unfolds on the top screen. Every scene is accompanied by rump-shaking tunes, but players have to keep the Elite Beat Agents grooving. The worse players do, the worse the story might end up. Whether they’re helping a lost dog find its way home or helping a babysitter charm a hunky football player, no crisis is too weird. The public knows of government agencies like the FBI and CIA, but little is known of this super-secret agency. Code-named Elite Beat Agents, these men in black are heroes' heroes and the coolest group of guys this world has ever known. Of course, according to official records, they do not exist. Their leader, an ex-CIA agent named Commander Kahn, scans the world for cries of help. When he finds one, he dispatches the agents, who assist their targets by performing a song and dance. The hypnotic nature of their rocking revives the targets with "Groovy" energy that boosts their willpower and helps them overcome their obstacles. Every stage is presented in a storyline fashion. All stages share similar basic elements and game flow: The player gets introduced to the target’s problem in a comical intro. Commander Kahn dispatches the agents to the scene. The agents arrive in a special "Beat Transport" that is tailor-made for the situation. The song starts as the agents and player meet the target. By tapping and tracing patterns that appear on-screen, players play along with the song’s rhythm. The animated story changes depending on how well the player performs. After each section, the player gets judged. Depending on the Elite-o-meter's judgment, the story will go well or poorly. If the player makes it though the whole song, he or she will be judged on the whole thing and get one of three endings.

Led by the young emperor Gulcasa, who seized control of the Empire in a brutal coup d?etat, Bronchia's Imperial Army cuts a bloody swath through the people of Fantasinia and the Royal Armies of King Ordeene. Amidst the chaos, a young woman escapes from the besieged capital of Partina -- a woman with innocence in her face, and a sword in her hand. The girl?s name is Princess Yggdra, the last surviving member of the royal family; the sword is the Gran Centurio, a legendary blade once wielded by the founder of Fantasinia, and passed down through generations of royalty. Fleeing to to a remote valley at the southern tip of the continent, Yggdra meets up with Milanor, the charismatic leader of a band of thieves, and readies herself for a war of liberation.</value></description></item><item><rating><value>67</value></rating><name><value>The King of Fighters '99: Evolution</value></name><images><value><url>http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/98w-game.jpg</url><path>full/459f2f8e961e05ec75a7e2d1ab98595e93984dd3.jpg</path><checksum>9934f3777db8b786cddff8855822764b</checksum></value></images><image_urls><value>http://static.metacritic.com/images/products/games/98w-game.jpg</value></image_urls><platform><value>Dreamcast</value></platform><num_of_players><value>1-2 </value></num_of_players><genre><value>Action</value></genre><description><value>The long-awaited "KOF Evolution" makes its way from the arcade to your home with a new story and new system.

These fast and furious 3D brawlers put a new spin on "last man standing" as characters take each other on in frenzied match ups amidst fully interactive environments. Utilizing a simple control scheme, players can execute standard moves such as punches and kicks but the deeper power struggle comes in the form of "power stones." Fighters vie to collect these gems in order to tip the scales in their favor, as nabbing three will allow them to transform into super fighters that can perform devastating power moves. In addition, a variety of zany weapons and the ability to use environments in creative ways allow an incredible level of freedom and depth beyond the typical fighting game.

As the main character and his friend Miki pass a leisurely afternoon, Miki suddenly collapses from an unknown illness. When the girl shows no sign of waking, the main character grows distraught over not being a better friend and not having the means to save her. Suddenly, a strange voice offers him a second chance: "Beyond the door you can change your destiny!" He soon leaves the real world and journeys to the world of Vision, where, as a novice "Traveler," he will surmount myriad ordeals in hopes of ultimately meeting with the Goddess of Fortune to have a single wish granted. The would-be hero quickly makes friends both strange and fascinating as he finds himself blossoming into a successful Traveler. His courage and resolve are tested time and again as he and his newfound companions travel the mysterious lands of Vision. The challenges he faces are daunting, but his growing sense of self and responsibility propel him ever forward. Valuable friendships, unbounded courage, and his own personal growth will all prove indispensable as he seeks out his destiny: a life-changing adventure and the discovery of a hero inside an ordinary kid.

Players assume the roles of more than 20 Marvel Super Heroes including Spider-Man, Wolverine, Blade and Captain America, and through their actions determine the fate of both planet Earth and the Marvel universe – revealed in one of multiple epilogues. Marvel: Ultimate Alliance offers total team customization, where players create their own team name, icon and vehicle, as well as establish their team reputation as they play throughout the story.  Gamers also have the option to level up each character individually to their liking, or all team members at the same time to keep their heroes balanced.  With the game's new combat system, players battle against the world's most notorious Marvel Super Villains in the air, underwater, and on the ground, using grappling, blocking and dodging moves, by charging up their Super Hero powers before unleashing them, and using environmental objects as one and two-handed weapons. Marvel:  Ultimate Alliance features a storyline where the missions players accept, the objectives they complete, and their interactions with other characters throughout the game directly impact how the story plays out. The game also features a robust multiplayer component where fans can band together with friends as their favorite Marvel Super Heroes, and fight evil in both on and offline cooperative story modes.  There's also a Competitive Mode where the game tracks various in-game stats so players can see how well they stack up against one another – affecting the amount of experience points earned and how equipment is distributed.

The intelligence of players has seen a marked improvement. For example, players now make more realistic runs into space, often pointing where they would like the ball played. The physical aspect has also been beefed up, with strikers using their sheer presence to turn defenders and likewise, the defenders stepping a yard away to enable them to force players away from goal and not letting them spin into dangerous positions. PES 6 also has a number of new teams licensed for inclusion, with the International roster now featuring the official kits for Argentina, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Sweden.

In addition, players now move, behave and position themselves more realistically. On attack, players analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. On defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. Plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better-urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in FIFA Soccer 10. In goal, a myriad of improvements and refinements to goalkeeper intelligence result in a more responsive and powerful rushing system and ultra-realistic saves. Better balance on lofted through balls, improved goalkeeper intelligence, more realistic shooting mechanics with less shots hitting the goal posts, a practice arena to perfect skills, and a more immersive soccer experience through continuous play and quick free kicks are just a few of the issues raised by fans and addressed in FIFA Soccer 10. Three new innovations revealed today at E3 have been developed to change the player control experience in FIFA Soccer 10. The first-ever true 360 degree dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.</value><value>FIFA Soccer 10 also features a deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode with more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves.

Set within a complex, hypnotic 3D world, players use the game's unique crush mechanic to "crush" the environment and transform it into a more simplified 2D platformer. Once flattened, players utilize the 2D space to move to new areas to solve otherwise impossible challenges, and unlock secret items that were previously unobtainable in the 3D environment. Players then "uncrush" the 2D environment and return to the 3D world. Designed for a wide and varied audience, Crush tells the story of Dan, a man with a lifetime of unresolved issues and bottled up emotions that has turned him into a nervous insomniac who is too tired to turn his life around. Desperate for a cure, he turns to hypnosis. It is during this state that he is given one last chance to sort through the wreckage of his past, before he loses the last thing he has – his sanity.

During that time, five brave heroes created armlets to restrain the demon gods. In a quest to turn back the rueful army, a young crusader named Jeanne is commanded by mysterious voices to use the power of the magical armlet to seal away the demon king and recover her homeland once and for all. Set among sprawling fields, battle-torn villages, and intricate dungeons, Jeanne d'Arc unfolds through more than 40 expansive and highly detailed environments, where players will engage in the pursuit of France's resurgence. Players control up to 14 characters throughout the journey, including humans and beasts, as they battle a variety of enemies in the quest to turn back the English domination. Jeanne d'Arc delivers a strategic, turn-based battle system where players engage in unique team attacks and defensive schemes, using multiple characters' skills in combination to create devastating strikes. Further adding to the depth of play, each character has access to one of eight weapon types that are also upgradeable as players' progress through the game. Additionally, players can customize their characters with more than 150 different skills and abilities throughout the game.

Especially one about a Vault key, the Hyperion Corporation, bandits, loot, gangsters, Vault Hunters, secret Atlas tech, explosions, getaways, extortion, betrayal, and mayhem. Set after the events seen in Borderlands 2, Tales from the Borderlands is about Rhys, a Hyperion company man looking to become the next Handsome Jack, and it’s also about Fiona, a Pandoran con artist out to score the biggest of all swindles. Lured into danger by a Vault key and all it promises, the unlikely duo are thrown together with a common goal and a huge amount of mistrust. Who is telling the truth, and why is it important That’s up to you to decide. You are Rhys…and you are also Fiona, because like every tale worth telling, there are two…oh, you read that part already?

The offense draws from the destiny deck which contains colors, wilds and specials.  He or she then takes the hyperspace gate and points at one planet in the system indicated by the drawn destiny card.  The offense vs. the defenses ships are in the encounter and both sides are able to invite allies, play an encounter card as well as special cards to try and tip the encounter in their favor.</value><value>The object of the game is to establish colonies in other players' planetary systems. Players take turns trying to establish colonies. The winner(s) are the first player(s) to have five colonies on any planets outside his or her home system. A player does not need to have colonies in all of the systems, just colonies on five planets outside his or her home system. These colonies may all be in one system or scattered over multiple systems. The players must use force, cunning, and diplomacy to ensure their victory.</value></description></item><item><rating><value>7.84</value></rating><name><value>Patchwork</value></name><images><value><url>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2270442_t.jpg</url><path>full/fd0dc8eba7c7e68a55ae67a3c7ad96e92ff77d55.jpg</path><checksum>3bca330d237a7e6cecbc79ac62b3c578</checksum></value></images><image_urls><value>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2270442_t.jpg</value></image_urls><platform><value>Board Game</value></platform><num_of_players><value>2</value></num_of_players><genre><value></value></genre><description><value>In </value><value>, two players compete to build the most aesthetic (and high-scoring) patchwork quilt on a personal 9x9 game board. To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly counter-clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons — the currency/points in the game — and someone is chosen as the start player.</value><value>On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch, move the spool to that patch's location in the circle, then add the patch to your game board. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.</value><value>In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you sum the number of buttons on your game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.</value><value>What's more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on his game board.</value><value>When a player takes an action that moves his time token to the central square of the time track, he places the purchased patch (assuming he had purchased one and wasn't passing), then takes one final button scoring from the bank. Once both players are in the center, each player loses two buttons for each blank square on his game board. Whoever has the most buttons wins.</value></description></item><item><rating><value>7.60</value></rating><name><value>Ticket to Ride: Europe</value></name><images><value><url>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic66668_t.jpg</url><path>full/0c762922c0ca24ef8301d03acf9ed87c2bd669ba.jpg</path><checksum>86378c04416678ffd9876baa6ef0a5e3</checksum></value></images><image_urls><value>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic66668_t.jpg</value></image_urls><platform><value>Board Game</value></platform><num_of_players><value>2 − 5</value></num_of_players><genre><value></value></genre><description><value> takes you on a new train adventure across Europe.

To set up the game, players choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, etc.), stack that particular villain's attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain's particular scheme. Players then choose a number of hero decks – Spider-Man, Hulk, Cyclops, Wolverine, etc. – and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what's available.</value><value>Over the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of five cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player's turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains "master strike" cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.</value><value>As players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game's end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme, however – having a certain number of villains escape, for example, or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes – then the players all lose.</value></description></item><item><rating><value>8.02</value></rating><name><value>The Voyages of Marco Polo</value></name><images><value><url>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2461346_t.png</url><path>full/dd4582d2c184915480442a0b469cce7b03668051.jpg</path><checksum>0221449d1722cb636116fad5e4f6f385</checksum></value></images><image_urls><value>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2461346_t.png</value></image_urls><platform><value>Board Game</value></platform><num_of_players><value>2 − 4</value></num_of_players><genre><value></value></genre><description><value>In 1271, 17-year-old Marco Polo started on a journey to China with his father and older brother.

Competing companies deal in spices, send ships and colonists into the world, and invest money. Are you on top or at the bottom? It depends on how you invest your profits. Will you make your ships more efficient? Enhance your plantations? Recruit more colonists? Only a steady hand in business will help.</value><value>Each turn begins with an auction phase, where each player gets to auction one item (and the starting player two items). The first item being auctioned gives the right to go first the next turn (along with a card that gives an extra action). If you buy your own item, you pay it to the bank. If someone else buys the item you sell, they pay you. Items include plantations complete with crops, income tiles (income in money, ships, plantation refills each turn etc.), ships, settlers, and later on tiles that score points for certain achievements.</value><value>After the auction, players get three actions to either improve their technologies or produce things such as spices on plantations, ships, money or build more plantations. Each player has a board showing their advancement for various things: getting ships, planting new spices, getting colonists, etc. The more a player advances along one track, the better one is doing that particular action. The further you get along a certain track, the more points that track is worth at the end, and there are also rewards to the first player who reaches the last two levels along each track.

Summon forth living manifestations of Chaos, debased and hidden cultists, and the horrifying greater daemons - beings capable of destroying near everything in their path.</value></description></item><item><rating><value>7.89</value></rating><name><value>Alchemists</value></name><images><value><url>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2241156_t.png</url><path>full/1d409e4f5019825214326fb78c72f3f1e883246e.jpg</path><checksum>ea33e3ecc80d0a630e71cd093ed2c04c</checksum></value></images><image_urls><value>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2241156_t.png</value></image_urls><platform><value>Board Game</value></platform><num_of_players><value>2 − 4</value></num_of_players><genre><value></value></genre><description><value>In </value><value>, two to four budding alchemists compete to discover the secrets of their mystical art. Points can be earned in various ways, but most points are earned by publishing theories – correct theories, that is — and therein lies the problem.</value><value>The game is played in six rounds. At the beginning of the round, players choose their play order. Those who choose to play later get more rewards.</value><value>
Players declare all their actions by placing cubes on the various action spaces, then each action space is evaluated in order. Players gain knowledge by mixing ingredients and testing the results using a smartphone app (iOS, Android, and also Windows) that randomizes the rules of alchemy for each new game. And if the alchemists are longing for something even more special, they can always buy magical artifacts to get an extra push. There are 9 of them (different for each game) and they are not only very powerful, but also very expensive. But money means nothing, when there's academic pride at stake! And the possession of these artifacts will definitely earn you some reputation too. Players can also earn money by selling potions of questionable quality to adventurers, but money is just a means to an end. The alchemists don't want riches, after all. They want respect, and respect usually comes from publishing theories.</value><value>During play, players' reputations will go up and down. After six rounds and a final exhibition, reputation will be converted into points. Points will also be scored for artifacts and grants. Then the secrets of alchemy are revealed and players score points or lose points based on whether their theories were correct. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.</value><value>
Mandrake root and scorpion tail; spongy mushroom and warty toad — these are the foundations of the alchemist's livelihood, science, and art.</value><value>But what arcane secrets do these strange ingredients hide? Now it is time to find out. Mix them into potions and drink them to determine their effects — or play it safe and test the concoction on a helpful assistant! Gain riches selling potions to wandering adventurers and invest these riches in powerful artifacts. As your knowledge grows, so will your reputation, as you publish your theories for all to see. Knowledge, wealth, and fame can all be found in the murky depths of the alchemist's cauldron.</value></description></item><item><rating><value>7.73</value></rating><name><value>Steam</value></name><images><value><url>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic392515_t.jpg</url><path>full/04070a5371684ae90a2f11b6312d767d1c7494bc.jpg</path><checksum>f155fdeb223bf47717c0a753e52d5666</checksum></value></images><image_urls><value>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic392515_t.jpg</value></image_urls><platform><value>Board Game</value></platform><num_of_players><value>3 − 5</value></num_of_players><genre><value></value></genre><description><value>In Steam you build railroads and deliver goods along an ever changing network of tracks and stations.

Each card has four possible uses: operational movement, strategic movement, special events, and replacement points.  The cardplay forces players to constantly make tough decsions as they feel that they need to do a little bit of everything but they can only do one thing at a time.

There is no sequence of play to follow, however: each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card "Orders" conducted by the active player. Fate Card "Actions" may generally be conducted by either player at any time. "Events" — both good and bad — will occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player’s perfect plan.</value><value>: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet of distance (about 30 meters). Each complete Player Phase abstractly represents several seconds of real time. Each complete measure of Game Time abstractly represents several minutes of real time.</value><value>Each unit in the game is approximated as either a single Leader, a 5-man Team, or a 10-man Squad.

Each player has their own board, with space for factories, and 4 rail tracks (to 4 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:</value><value>
- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.</value><value>
- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.</value><value>

On each line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts.

After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.</value><value>In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).</value><value>A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.</value><value>The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large cube) and in the region containing the king.</value></description></item><item><rating><value>7.90</value></rating><name><value>Caylus</value></name><images><value><url>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1638795_t.jpg</url><path>full/bbd3d52c0772ccfa2847c6b844e593540888d9d5.jpg</path><checksum>f23a26becfef8e0a78bf652d67bf8201</checksum></value></images><image_urls><value>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1638795_t.jpg</value></image_urls><platform><value>Board Game</value></platform><num_of_players><value>2 − 5</value></num_of_players><genre><value></value></genre><description><value>Once upon a time ...</value><value>

For the time being, </value><value> is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up.</value><value>The players embody master builders.

When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game.  The expansion </value><value> was included in the 2nd Edition.</value><value>Each turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.</value><value>As new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game. Generally, if players are building many buildings and the Provost is generous in allowing them to be used, the game ends more quickly.</value></description></item><item><rating><value>7.86</value></rating><name><value>7 Wonders</value></name><images><value><url>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic860217_t.jpg</url><path>full/8d733a722bd75e7ff67cf86bec21a9297579fe96.jpg</path><checksum>a24e7425f93167b47b4707701d90a980</checksum></value></images><image_urls><value>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic860217_t.jpg</value></image_urls><platform><value>Board Game</value></platform><num_of_players><value>2 − 7</value></num_of_players><genre><value></value></genre><description><value>You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World.

90,000 B.C. — A great ice age is fast approaching. Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species. </value><value>
</value><value> is a game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth. </value><value>
Each player will assume the role of one of six major animal classes—mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid, or insect. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won’t last: It is indeed "survival of the fittest".</value><value>
Through wily action pawn placement, players will strive to become dominant on as many different terrain tiles as possible in order to claim powerful card effects. Players will also want to propagate their individual species in order to earn victory points for their particular animal. Players will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration, and adaptation actions, among others. </value><value>
All of this eventually leads to the end game—the final ascent of the ice age—where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have his animal crowned the Dominant Species. </value><value>
But somebody better become dominant quickly, because it’s getting mighty cold...</value><value>
The large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of earth as it might have appeared a thousand centuries ago. The smaller tundra tiles will be placed atop the larger tiles—converting them into tundra in the process—as the ice age encroaches.</value><value>
The cylindrical action pawns (or "AP"s) drive the game. Each AP will allow a player to perform the various actions that can be taken, such as speciation, environmental change, migration, or glaciation. After being placed on the action display during the Planning Phase, an AP will trigger that particular action for the owning player during the Execution Phase.</value><value>
Generally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal’s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents’—hopefully collecting valuable victory points (or "VP"s) along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.</value><value>
Throughout the game, species cubes will be added to, moved about in, and removed from the tiles in play (the "earth"). Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth. </value><value>
When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile—after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins the game.</value><value>

You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition – or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact!

Set in the cyberpunk future of </value><value> and </value><value>, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners.</value><value>Corporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with "ice". These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation's virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.</value><value>In turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It's not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort's defenses, there's no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing.</value><value>The first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity.</value></description></item><item><rating><value>8.09</value></rating><name><value>The Castles of Burgundy</value></name><images><value><url>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1176894_t.jpg</url><path>full/6d3ec02b2fa322ec7e70139e279cda3e9e72be6a.jpg</path><checksum>2671960b646ce828ea7dd8f42a41047d</checksum></value></images><image_urls><value>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1176894_t.jpg</value></image_urls><platform><value>Board Game</value></platform><num_of_players><value>2 − 4</value></num_of_players><genre><value></value></genre><description><value>The game is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France. Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.</value><value>The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.</value><value>The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points.  Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.</value><value>The game ends when the last player finishes his turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase.  Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods.

The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.</value><value>Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.</value><value>The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.</value><value>During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as "Trader" or "Builder"). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the "Builder" role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.</value><value>Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a "governor" token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.</value><value>Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned "large buildings." Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.</value></description></item><item><rating><value>8.27</value></rating><name><value>Caverna: The Cave Farmers</value></name><images><value><url>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1790789_t.jpg</url><path>full/46e563287b28c324d9220d3944e03f81c1776f5a.jpg</path><checksum>a61fee6000372ecfd1877e3bcfe5276f</checksum></value></images><image_urls><value>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1790789_t.jpg</value></image_urls><platform><value>Board Game</value></platform><num_of_players><value>1 − 7</value></num_of_players><genre><value></value></genre><description><value>Following along the same lines as its predecessor (</value><value>), </value><value> is a worker-placement game at heart, with a focus on farming.

You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?</value><value>The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof.

There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).</value><value>
Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.</value><value>
Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.</value><value>
Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions.</value></description></item><item><rating><value>8.03</value></rating><name><value>Brass</value></name><images><value><url>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic261878_t.jpg</url><path>full/dfb5b0549803872a616ca0434e750d04f1c66868.jpg</path><checksum>2f4b80bd3ffb2e707cb8a6769bc6a3a3</checksum></value></images><image_urls><value>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic261878_t.jpg</value></image_urls><platform><value>Board Game</value></platform><num_of_players><value>3 − 4</value></num_of_players><genre><value></value></genre><description><value>In </value><value> the players represent industrialists in northern England during the heyday of the industrial revolution.  Each player needs to build an economic engine that surpasses the other by the time railways are established and the foreign markets have been saturated with English cotton.</value><value>The goal of the game is to have the most points at the end of the game.  These are obtained in three ways: </value><value>
1) Building industries and having them successfully utilized </value><value>
2) Building canal or rail connections to cities that have many successfully utilized industries </value><value>
3) money at the end of the game (very inefficient).</value><value>Game play is divided into two phases - the Canal Phase and the Rail Phase.  At the beginning of each phase players are dealt a hand of cards that represent a mix of the cities and the available industries.</value><value>
  </value><value>
On his turn, a player has two actions (except first turn of the game where there is only one action) and must spend a card for each one.  Available actions include: </value><value>
1) building an industry</value><value>
2) building a connection [either canals or rails based on phase of the game]</value><value>
3) develop their own industries which removes lower victory point industries from a player's board in favor of higher victory point ones</value><value>
4) sell cotton</value><value>
5) take a loan (absolutely necessary a few times a game).</value><value>At the end of a player's turn they replace the two cards they played with two more from the deck.  Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn - from lowest spent first to highest spent.  This turn order mechanic opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order allowing possibility of back-to-back turns.</value><value>After all the cards have been played the first time (deck size adjusted for number of players) the Canal Phase ends and a scoring round commences.  After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed for the game, new cards are dealt and the Rail Phase begins. Rail Phase is identical to Canal Phase except players may now occupy more than one location in a city and a double connection build (though expensive) is possible.  At the end of the Rail Phase there is another scoring round and a winner is crowned.</value><value>The use of the cards limit where you can build your industries but any card can be used for the develop, sell cotton or building connections actions.  This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards.  Resources are common so that if one player builds a rail line (which requires coal) they have to use the coal from the nearest source which may be an opponent's coal mine which gets that coal mine closer to scoring (i.e. being utilized).</value><value>[Side Note]</value><value>
Brass provides a game of timing and positioning yourself to have your opponents propel you victory.  The rule book is notorious for being difficult to understand (though has been significantly fixed in the most recent edition).  After a few turns the game reveals itself to being far more simple than the rules suggest.  A teacher or viewing a how to play video is definitely worth the time.</value></description></item><item><rating><value>7.98</value></rating><name><value>Le Havre</value></name><images><value><url>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic447994_t.jpg</url><path>full/3eae793bd9a4b85eb75dfceec7c273f35579385d.jpg</path><checksum>7d529f73e6d05fc87c74c682d814c7dd</checksum></value></images><image_urls><value>https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic447994_t.jpg</value></image_urls><platform><value>Board Game</value></platform><num_of_players><value>1 − 5</value></num_of_players><genre><value></value></genre><description><value>In </value><value>, a player’s turn consists of two parts: First, distribute newly supplied goods onto the offer spaces; then take an action.

Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.</value><value>One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture.
