      <value>Like all good tales, there’s more than one side to a story. Especially one about a Vault key, the Hyperion Corporation, bandits, loot, gangsters, Vault Hunters, secret Atlas tech, explosions, getaways, extortion, betrayal, and mayhem. Set after the events seen in Borderlands 2, Tales from the Borderlands is about Rhys, a Hyperion company man looking to become the next Handsome Jack, and it’s also about Fiona, a Pandoran con artist out to score the biggest of all swindles. Lured into danger by a Vault key and all it promises, the unlikely duo are thrown together with a common goal and a huge amount of mistrust. Who is telling the truth, and why is it important That’s up to you to decide. You are Rhys…and you are also Fiona, because like every tale worth telling, there are two…oh, you read that part already? Well, it’s important to remember that there *are* two sides to every story, and you my friend, you will tell this tale, or…tales, through the choices that you make. Your every decision as both Rhys and Fiona will affect the people and world around you: this is a game where YOU are the final author in a brand new Borderlands story set on the unforgiving world of Pandora.

      <value>The YO-KAI WATCH game is about hundreds of sometimes cute, sometimes spooky, and usually mischievous Yo-kai that inhabit our world. Yo-kai are not ghosts, monsters or creatures. Yo-kai are, quite simply, Yo-kai. They cannot be seen by the human eye, but they are everywhere. Whether born from the soul of a deceased human, or an everyday object discovering its higher purpose, their personalities are distinctly humanlike.</value>

With Perfect Defence, players who time their tackles perfectly are able to powerfully shove their opponent out of the way and instantly secure the ball, allowing to create direct turnarounds and counter opportunities.</value>

Manipulate gravity to redefine the ceiling as the floor while venturing through impossible architectures. Explore increasingly difficult worlds, each uniquely detailed and designed to leave the player with a pronounced sense of intellectual accomplishment. The Bridge exemplifies games as an art form, with beautifully hand-drawn art in the style of a black-and-white lithograph.</value>

      <value>There once was an era in which the earth was inhabited by gods, humans, and an evil deity from the underworld known as the Demon God. Under the flag of the holy maiden Vitoria, humans fought against the spirits, or monsters, who worked as the Demon’s pawns for ages. – God's Era, Year 395. A technique for capturing monsters into a magical tome called a Sealbook was invented by the first royal alchemist, Siegdrad. A new, special class called Libras handled this sealing magic, and they garnered tremendous results in regard to monster suppression. Thanks to their efforts, the monsters’ population plummeted, and eventually the Demon God herself was sealed away. The world began to operate under the rule of humanity. Then came the King’s Era, Year 1. Vitoria had achieved continental unification through the hard work of mankind, and succeeded the throne as First Queen of the Kingdom of Romulea. [Atlus]</value>

      <value>Actual Sunlight is a short interactive story about love, depression and the corporation. The game puts you in the role of Evan Winter, a young professional in Toronto, as he moves through three distinct periods of his life. The story is linear, unavoidable and (hopefully) thought-provoking. You experience his perceptions, fall under the consequences of his decisions, and meet everyone who didn't change him.</value>

      <value>Strange occurrences are disrupting the routines of the PATHOS-2 research facility. The radio is silent. Behavioral anomalies of the machines are increasingly dangerous, if not... malevolent. The facility is devolving into chaos. No weapons, and the only escape is practically unthinkable. From Frictional Games, creators of the Amnesia and Penumbra series, SOMA is an aberrant tale of scientific inquiry and survival; an entropic exploration of synapse and circuit that wades through the delusions of human consciousness.</value>

      <value>Like all good tales, there’s more than one side to a story. Especially one about a Vault key, the Hyperion Corporation, bandits, loot, gangsters, Vault Hunters, secret Atlas tech, explosions, getaways, extortion, betrayal, and mayhem. Set after the events seen in Borderlands 2, Tales from the Borderlands is about Rhys, a Hyperion company man looking to become the next Handsome Jack, and it’s also about Fiona, a Pandoran con artist out to score the biggest of all swindles. Lured into danger by a Vault key and all it promises, the unlikely duo are thrown together with a common goal and a huge amount of mistrust. Who is telling the truth, and why is it important That’s up to you to decide. You are Rhys…and you are also Fiona, because like every tale worth telling, there are two…oh, you read that part already? Well, it’s important to remember that there *are* two sides to every story, and you my friend, you will tell this tale, or…tales, through the choices that you make. Your every decision as both Rhys and Fiona will affect the people and world around you: this is a game where YOU are the final author in a brand new Borderlands story set on the unforgiving world of Pandora.

      <value>Players engage in nonstop shooter action as they're propelled through this on-rails game. Isa and Kachi are being hunted. They go on the run and on the defensive. And they shoot everything. Sin &amp; Punishment 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the Japanese Nintendo 64 cult-classic shooter. It brings a frantic arcade sensibility to a post-apocalyptic world. Players can run on foot or take to the skies with a jetpack or hovering skateboard-like device to dodge enemy attacks or get a better lock on their targets. Players can fire at targets in the distance or switch to sword attacks for close-range targets. The Wii Remote controller's pointing ability is used to aim weapons, while the Nunchuk controller is used for positioning and maneuvering. Numerous beautifully rendered settings include gorgeous cityscapes and dramatic underwater tunnels, all populated by fierce enemies. It's all about the multiplier. The better a player's skills, the more points are earned, and the bigger the bonus. Players will want to play the game again and again to beat their personal best on each level. The better the performance, the bigger the multiplier and the higher the final score. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>Race Driver: Create and Race has been designed from the ground up for Nintendo DS and lets players thrash the most formidable sports cars through closely-fought races on the world's most prestigious circuits... and then lets players create their own circuits with a full track construction kit. Using the DS stylus, the game's track editor lets players select and place race track elements, such as hairpin corners, long straights and chicanes, to design unique circuits. Once all the pieces are placed to perfection, players can take to their track and experience exactly what it's like in aggressive multiple car races. In addition to the track editor, the game features 32 real-world circuits – from Silverstone and the Nurburgring to Bathurst – and 25 officially licensed race cars, including the AMG Mercedes C Klasse D, and the Chevrolet Silverado Truck. Making use of the Nintendo DS Wi-Fi connection capabilities, players can challenge others to races on the game's official tracks as well as the circuits of their creation. Race Driver: Create and Race also enables up to four players to go head-to-head in races gamesharing from only one cartridge. Further championships and cars can be unlocked from the World Tour Mode and then raced in realtime online and ad hoc multiplayer modes. [Codemasters]</value>

      <value>Major League Baseball 2K5 debuts On Command Baserunning, that includes active picture-in-picture baserunning, and new gameplay features called Maximum Sliding and Baseburner Mode. Active picture-in-picture baserunning delivers both an exciting presentation style and an intuitive method to precisely control runners. The new baserunning mechanic utilizes the right analog thumbstick to choose how baserunners slide -- head or feet first -- in conjunction with hook sliding left or right of the base. Players will be able to reach a base quicker, get up more quickly from a slide, or avoid being tagged out with the new freedom found in Maximum Sliding. Baseburner Mode allows the gamer to play any 'at-bat' through the perspective of any baserunner, delivering precision control to gamers.</value>

      <value>Sega GT 2002 features more than 125 current and classic high-performance vehicles that reflect the handling and performance specifications from their real-life counterparts. Chronicle mode puts you behind the wheel of hot rods from the 60s, 70s, and 80s, while the Quick Battle mode lets you jump right into the action. The true test, however, lies in Sega GT 2002 mode, in which you must win races and collect enough cash to buy new cars and upgrade the classics. You can showcase cars in the Virtual Garage alongside trophies and other mementos.</value>

      <value>Lego Star Wars II takes the fun and customization ability of the LEGO play pattern and combines it with the epic story, characters and action from the revolutionary Star Wars: Episodes IV, V and VI. With a unique tongue-in-cheek take on the Original Trilogy, LEGO Star Wars II lets you build and battle your way through your favorite film moments. From Darth Vader's pursuit of Princess Leia aboard her Blockade Runner to Luke's final confrontation with Emperor Palpatine. For the first time ever, characters can get in and out of vehicles, as well as ride creatures. Because it's LEGO style, you can also mix and match the body parts of more than 50 playable characters to create one of millions of possible LEGO Star Wars heroes. And on PS2, Xbox and Windows platforms, a game save from the first LEGO Star Wars can unlock another 50-plus additional characters for Free Play mode -- that's more than 100 total characters. Other exciting additions include free-roaming vehicle levels, the ability to switch ships at will in Free Play mode, cool new character-specific attacks and maneuvers, playable mini-kit vehicles, an adaptive difficulty option and more.</value>

      <value>Sega Sports™ NBA 2K3 powers forward with the kind of improvements that only results from an off-season dedicated to perfection. Imagine jump shots so real players actually adjust their movement in mid-air, based on distance from the hoop and defensive pressure; a passing touch that gives you the control to skirt a defender or air-out a fast break; dribble moves that let you jab left, rock right, crossover, and spin; and much more. It's all happening in NBA 2K3.</value>

Be the noble hero embarking on an epic quest or an insidious thief rising to leadership of his guild.  Be a malevolent sorcerer developing the ultimate spell of destruction or a reverent healer searching for the cure to a plague.  Your actions define your character, and your gameplay changes and evolves in response to your actions.  Confront the assassins' guild, and they'll take out a contract on you.  Impress them, and they try to recruit you instead.  No two sagas are the same in the world of Morrowind.</value>

      <value>The second game in the popular court room battle series from Japan introduces four new cases featuring new characters, plot twists and gameplay features.  Players resume the role of Phoenix Wright, a defence attorney who must prove his client’s innocence against the toughest of odds and most ruthless of adversaries.  Players must exercise their legal prowess as they collect evidence, examine witnesses, analyse testimonies and seek the truth to ensure that justice prevails. New "Psyche-Lock" feature – some witnesses may be keeping the truth under tight lock and key, so in order to break them down, successfully open up their Psyche- Locks with a series of correct questions or catch them on their inconsistent testimony. New life bar represents Phoenix’s status in court – by presenting incorrect evidence or following misguided attempts to break Psyche Locks, Phoenix’s life bar will go down; the only way to regain this stat is to successfully open a witness’s Psyche-Lock. Colourful cast of characters include both new &amp; familiar faces:  Franziska von Karma – the new D.A. and daughter of former adversary, Manfred von Karma, is on the warpath to take Phoenix down and avenge her father by any means necessary; Maya Fey – having honed her psychic powers, she is now a mystic of the Kurain Channeling Technique and will continue to be a valuable ally for Phoenix in his trials; Pearl Fey – Maya’s cousin is an up and coming psychic herself and looks up to her as a role model.

      <value>[DSiWare]  The year is 2099, and the solar system is littered with space junk. Our best hope for a tidier cosmos is to send the Flametail incinerator pod from planet to planet for a little fiery cleanup. Take control of the Flametail pod and start winding your way through obstacles, then watch as your flaming tail ignites blocks of troublesome debris and eventually eliminates them. Be careful not to work yourself into a dead end, and don't let the hazard line that follows you catch up to your tail or reach any leftover garbage. Luckily, you can find useful items (such as bombs or score multipliers) along your path and earn special power-ups (like radar or a missile) by collecting letter panels to spell particular words. Effectively burn up the floating garbage in the game's two modes - Space Tour and Time Limit - and earn new graphics and other surprises as you progress. The straightforward controls make it possible for anyone to take on the job of restoring space to pristine condition. Do you have what it takes to make your way to the outer reaches of the solar system?</value>

      <value>In the original Mario vs. Donkey Kong, Mario was trying to find all the Mini Marios ... but this time, it's up to them to save the day. Players use the stylus and the touch screen to guide Mini Marios through mind-boggling, obstacle-filled levels. Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2 allows players to create their own maps with a new level editor. Once a map is created, players can send it across the world via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Players also can use Wi-Fi to download maps created by others, check out a player-ranking system and access special bonuses. Pauline returns! Pauline appeared in the original Donkey Kong as the woman that Mario was attempting to rescue, and was one of the first recognizable characters created by Nintendo. After a decades-long hiatus, Pauline is finally returning to the world of video games in Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2. Pauline is the object of Donkey Kong's misplaced affections, so players must rescue her all over again. It seems folks love those Mini Mario toys. So much so that the Mario Toy Company has expanded the line to include Mini Donkey Kong, Mini Toad and Mini Peach figures to the series. With all these toys bringing him more money than he knows what to do with, Mario decides to fulfill his lifelong dream and open a theme park called Super Mini Mario World. The opening-day crowd includes Pauline and Donkey Kong, who immediately falls head over heels for the lovely lass. The proud ape tries to show off his Mini DK toy to Pauline, but she picks the Mini Mario toy over his and the jealous Donkey Kong becomes enraged. He smashes the displays, destroys the toys and takes Pauline to the top floor of the amusement park. Players must find Pauline and save the day. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>Somewhere between heaven and the underworld -- in the center of a quiet lake -- stood an ancient castle known as Aventheim.  One night, without warning, denizens of the netherworld emerged and slaughtered the kingdom; nary a soul was left alive. Within an abandoned, long-forgotten church deep in the woods, a wisp is set free.  Bereft of memory, it is drawn toward the monster-infested castle and re-awakens the souls of the vanquished knights, leading them back towards the fallen stronghold to confront the very forces of evil that took their lives. An experience unlike any before it -- Incorporating strategy RPG, real-time strategy, and shooter elements, you've never experienced a game like this.  Control a Wisp with your stylus and activate the souls of deceased knights to aid you in destroying foes on the map.  Enemies fire bullets in multiple directions, making it vital for players to master the unique touch controls. Over 100 playable characters -- Find and recruit the ghosts of seven different classes of knights from your kingdom, and learn of their pasts, hopes, dreams, and untimely deaths.  Sacrifice their souls to one another to balance their skills and create your ultimate party. A tale from two perspectives -- This twice-told legend entangles you in a dark and brooding tale that is simultaneously examined through events both past and present.  Complete the adventure to unlock the ability to play through the game with a new narrative twist, placing the antagonist in the starring role. [Atlus USA]</value>

His studies evaluated the impact of performing certain reading and mathematic exercises to help stimulate the brain. Brain Age presents quick mental activities that help keep your DS brain in shape. Activities include quickly solving simple math problems, counting people going in and out of a house simultaneously, drawing pictures on the Touch Screen, reading classic literature out loud, and more. You can also play sudoku, the number puzzle game which has become an extremely popular feature in U.S. newspapers. On your first day of exercise, you will take a series of tests and get a score that determines how old your brain is. This number is called your "DS Brain Age". By performing daily exercises just minutes a day over weeks and months, the better you'll get at the exercises and the lower your DS Brain Age will become. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>[DSiWare; also known as "Reflect Missile"]  Trajectile is a puzzle game that's as much about firepower as it is about brainpower, requiring you to line up your shot and launch a flurry of missiles at enemy targets. Three types of missiles are at your disposal, each one with its own characteristics - but all of them can bounce off walls on their path to smash, blast or drill through enemies and blocks. Along the way, you'll find item blocks just waiting to be destroyed so that you can obtain special power-ups ... and cause even more destruction. Be careful though, as missile type and position are predetermined and you get only a limited number of launches per stage. Complete multiple classes containing numerous individual stages, earning medals when you clear stages in fewer than the given number of turns. Are you ready to take aim at becoming a Trajectile master? [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>[DSiWare; Also known as "Sujin Taisen: Number Battles"] From Japan comes NUMBER BATTLE, a board game that invokes the ancient art of feng shui while challenging players to clear the playing field. Take turns against human or computer opponents to reach a target score by placing numbered tiles on the board and linking the arms of each tile in various ways. Watch for the Winds of Change to possibly blow over the board during a battle, resulting in special squares that will score bonus points or affect game play in new ways. Items that aid you in your pursuit of points can also be found, but they'll cost you points and must be placed strategically. Go it alone in the main Story or Puzzle modes, or battle against up to three opponents from around the world via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection (broadband Internet access required). You can even learn from your past with History mode, which shows the moves recorded during previous contests. This unique combination of puzzle and strategy elements results in an exciting battle of wits. Can you guide your Warrior to victory? [Nintendo]</value>

The 17 new, engaging activities are all designed to help work the brain. Whether players are playing simple songs on a piano keyboard or monitoring the photo finish of a footrace, they'll love this new mental workout. When starting a new game, players take a series of tests and get a score that shows how old their brain is. This number is called the "DS Brain Age." With daily training over weeks and months, players strive to improve their mental acuity and lower their "DS Brain Age." Progress is charted in graph form. Players can keep up to four save files on one game card. Sharing a game allows players to engage in a picture-drawing quiz or other challenges with family and friends. Players also can use DS Download Play to send a demo to friends or compete with up to 16 players in one of four fun modes. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>In a frantic battle to the checkered flag, Sonic and friends speed around tracks set in medieval castle ramparts, lush rainforests and bustling cities, all taken from the visually rich and varied universes of Sonic and SEGA. Fan favorites such as Dr. Eggman, Tails, AiAi, Amigo and many more will join Sonic in their custom built vehicles, revving their engines and jostling to stay ahead of the pack. Each character will speed around the track in cars, planes, motorbikes, and in Aiai’s case – a banana mobile! Secret short cuts, swift handling and avoiding strategically placed obstacles are certainly the best way to get to the top of the podium. But winning is only part of the fun in Sonic &amp; SEGA All-Stars Racing! Each character has a specific All Star move – such as Super Sonic, Banana Blitz and Tails Tornado – that allows a quick way for competitors to get back into the race! Power ups and weapons can also be collected around the tracks and used against the opposition to ensure they don’t become a threat to that number one position. [Sega]</value>

Players star as rookie defense attorney Apollo Justice as he visits crime scenes, questions key witnesses and collects vital evidence before stepping into the courtroom to prove his clients' innocence. Facing Apollo across the courtroom is the highly talented and flamboyant prosecutor Klavier Gavin who, in addition to being a legal genius, is also lead singer with Gavinners, a highly successful rock band with a string of hits to their name. He may be young and inexperienced but Apollo's confident manner and passion, coupled with his unique ability to uncover witnesses' lies by studying their body language, will prove invaluable assets in the courtroom as he pleads the case for the defense. Thankfully, Apollo is not alone and is aided both in and out of the courtroom by his assistant Trucy, a mysterious female magician. Apollo also receives invaluable advice from his mentor the ultra-cool Kristoph Gavin, elder brother of Klavier, whose perfect logic and natural instincts have won him numerous cases and the respect of his colleagues.

      <value>(Also known as "Race Driver: GRID")  GRID takes players to dramatic and beautifully realized race locations over three continents to compete in a variety of racing events. Packed with the most powerful race cars - new and classic, circuit and drift - players compete to conquer the most prestigious official race tracks and championships then beyond to compete in challenging city-based competitions, and then on through to road events and urban street races. The drama, the rivalries, the aggression and the crashes; this is not a game about collecting cars or spending all of your time in the front-end tuning suspension settings or designing liveries. Codemasters wants to make racing exciting again. Gamers compete on Europe's greatest official race tracks in prestige Marques including Aston Martin, Koenigsegg and Pagani. Iconic cities across the U.S, including San Francisco, Washington DC and Detroit - each with their own atmosphere and events - play host to diverse street races, where high-performance V8 muscle cars set the pace in aggressive, closely fought pack competitions. And in the Far East, Japanese racing culture sets the tone where night races, including Drift racing, takes drivers through neon illuminated cities and to outlying mountain roads. There's also the opportunity to compete in races that operate on the fringes of legality in the back streets and industrial areas of Yokohama. [Codemasters]</value>

      <value>Inspired by the top-rated animated series seen on Disney Channel and soon to debut on Disney XD, Phineas and Ferb for Nintendo DS invites fans to play as the characters Phineas and Ferb in a series of wacky, fun-filled adventures. As Phineas and Ferb, players can build the world's most outrageous roller coaster from their backyard to the city; create a humungous snow ride from a snow cone machine - in the middle of summer; and hop behind the wheel of a monster truck and navigate through a muddy obstacle course. Along the way, players can use cool gadgets and objects that give them special powers. They also can complete unique mini games and puzzles such as Welding, Wind Blaster, and "You’re so busted!" mini games with Candace in order to advance through levels. Many other popular characters from the Disney series join Phineas and Ferb throughout the game. Fans can play as "Agent P" the family pet platypus who leads a double life as a secret agent.  In the game "Agent P" encounters the infamous Dr. Doofenshmirtz and battles him in a 1-on-1 challenge. Tattletale teenage sister Candace is always lurking and ready to tell Mom about the boys’ latest caper. Plus, Isabella, the Fireside Girls, Baljeet and others make appearances throughout the adventure. The game also features DGamer, Disney’s online community designed exclusively for Disney gamers. DGamer allows players to engage with other Disney game players in a secure online community via their Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection or online at www.DGamer.com. The service allows users to log into their DS and online accounts to create and customize a unique 3-D avatar and persistent profile. Kids can chat, view user profiles of their DGamer friends, and post high scores to leaderboards. [Disney]</value>

      <value>[DSiWare]   Climb the corporate ladder in the world of BOXLIFE using your wits and... paper? Use the Nintendo DSi stylus to cut and then manipulate the paper into a box shape. Be careful-if you're not efficient with your cuts, you'll waste paper and be penalized. R&amp;D mode teaches you new patterns and challenges you to complete various ranks, while FACTORY mode gives you the chance to earn money by making as many boxes as possible from an endless sheet of paper. Success in each mode brings its own reward: Clear ranks to earn a promotion, change your character's appearance, and use your earnings to acquire new items for your character's miniature garden. With this game's stylish graphics and catchy sounds, thinking inside the box isn't such a bad thing. [Nintendo]</value>

You are an elite soldier hand-picked for the Strike Team, outfitted with a Demonica environment suit and posted to the Red Sprite under Commander Gore.

      <value>Players star as a defense attorney, who must prove a seemingly guilty client's innocence no matter how dire the circumstances may seem. Phoenix faces the toughest prosecutor yet as the mysterious hard-boiled "Godot" tries to take him down at any cost. Players must collect evidence, survey crime scenes, weed through inconsistent testimonies, and overcome corrupt agendas to ensure that justice prevails. With the return of the popular "psyche-lock" interrogation tool from the previous title, "Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Justice for All," players have to overcome even more intense courtroom standoffs in order to close the case. Maya Fey is a bright young girl that aids Phoenix in his trials; she harnesses her psychic powers which are useful in a pinch. Godot - the mysterious, hard-boiled prosecutor makes his appearance. Play as two lawyers - relive Mia's rookie days from the past and Phoenix's current cases in the present. Two distinct gameplay segments: Investigation phase - survey crime scenes, interview witnesses and gather evidence that will be used in court; Court phase - present findings from the investigation to support your case, listen to testimonies and examine witnesses. "Psyche-Lock" system - break down tough witnesses with a series of correct questions or catch them on inconsistencies. Touch screen interface progresses players through the game. Microphone can be used to yell "Objection!" and "Hold it!" as you cross examine witnesses. [Capcom]</value>

      <value>Fire Emblem returns to its roots with a total overhaul of an NES classic never before released in America. New features include touch-screen controls, multiple save options and easy-to-follow tutorial chapters that shed new light on Marth's story. New players can jump into the action, even if they've never played a Fire Emblem game before.  Medeus, the king of the dragonkin, has been revived and is forming an alliance with a fearsome sorcerer named Gharnef. Together, they threaten to the throw the entire continent of Archanea back to an age of chaos and war. Now, it's up to young Prince Marth and his small band of loyal followers to rise up and rally all those left in the land to make one last desperate push to free Archanea from the tyranny of the Shadow Dragon. How to progress through the game: Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon is a turn-based strategy game with a fantasy setting. Players alternate turns with opponents, moving their pieces (units) and attacking enemy units on the battlefield. There are dozens of units and different weapons and magic spells, each with its own strategic benefits-high-flying Pegasus knights move effortlessly over varied terrain, fast-moving mounted cavaliers can use swords and lances, unarmed curates use healing staves to mend the wounds of other units and so on.

      <value>Set in the Warlords universe, Puzzle Quest challenges gamers to create, develop and customize the ultimate hero to save the land of Etheria from the evil Lord Bane. In order to advance, players battle in turn-based, head-to-head "match-three" style puzzle games in one of three distinct gameplay modes: Single-player allows gamers to battle against the computer AI as they embark on over 150 challenging quests, Instant Action allows gamers to jump in and immediately play continuous battles to level-up characters without participating in quests, and Multiplayer allows gamers to battle live opponents via wireless connectivity. Victory will advance the player’s hero, magical arsenal, creature companions and more - ultimately rewarding gamers at nearly every turn and providing endless hours of replayablity.

      <value>You are a ninja in N+. Your god-like speed, dexterity, jumping power, and reflexes are all the result of an amazingly fast metabolism; sadly, so is your natural lifespan of 1.5 minutes. Like all Ninjas, you have an unquenchable thirst for gold and a natural propensity for exploring rooms infested by increasingly lethal Ninja-killing robots. N emphasizes pacifism, humility, and the need to traverse 5 rooms before the end of your lifetime; a feat known only as ‘beating an episode’. In accordance with the teachings of N, it is your profound hope that one day you will develop your platforming skills, intelligence, and inexplicable ability to reincarnate to achieve total mastery of all 300 levels.

In this two-in-one adventure, players explore five exotic worlds, fight a variety of opponents, and venture through more than 30 levels, including nearly a dozen hidden levels while taking on outrageous world-ending bosses. The separate worlds on the two Nintendo DS screens have a cause and effect inter-relationship, and players choose when to switch between conquering the action-platform realm and mastering the increasingly challenging puzzle world. A wide variety of power-ups help Hatsworth in both of these worlds. Players complete puzzle combinations and defeat puzzle enemies in order to gain power ups, health, and energy to supercharge Hatsworth in his adventure. [Electronic Arts]</value>

      <value>(Also known as "Anno 1404: Dawn of Discovery")  Dawn of Discovery takes place in the year 1404, when King George's land is suffering from severe droughts and brutal famine. Aware of his people's distress, the king calls on his two sons, William and Edward, to acquire new territories in order to produce enough goods to satisfy the needs of his empire’s inhabitants. Whereas Edward suggests aggressive means to collect the precious resources, his brother William offers a peaceful solution, proposing to explore new and unsettled lands in the south of the kingdom. With his Father’s blessing, William heads south to the mysterious Orient and returns with valuable new technologies such as the water pump that allows dry lands to be cultivated in order to produce enough food for the people. But there are still many unmet needs within the king's empire, and players are tasked with the mission of fulfilling those needs while both expanding and sustaining the vast society. Build and sustain your own expansive empire. Explore the beautifully detailed world and discover new places to create your civilization. Set up trade posts in the spice mines of the Orient and explore new trade routes to keep your nation growing. Learn from other nearby cultures to expand your horizons and master the challenges of establishing a prosperous society. [Ubisoft]</value>

      <value>[DSiWare]  Your journey through the universe of X-Scape begins as you wake from 10 years of cryosleep, only to find yourself unexpectedly thrown into a fearsome battle against an evil empire bent on your destruction. You'll travel to numerous planets in the Kiisa system and engage in a wide variety of challenges (including optional side quests) in your fight for survival. At your command is VIXIV, an advanced battle tank able to deftly maneuver on land or in the air while loaded with an array of formidable weapons. To help with advice or upgrades to VIXIV's abilities, you've also got your highly capable support bot, VIX-529. Use the touch screen to pilot VIXIV in one of two modes: tunnel mode and free-movement mode. In tunnel mode, you'll navigate through narrow, dangerous tunnels that connect planets. Successful completion of tunnel mode opens free-movement mode, which allows you to freely roam the surfaces of planets and take up missions. Presented in 3-D with a stylishly retro graphic presentation, X-Scape combines continuous action with an epic story to create an experience that's sure to keep players on the edge of their seats.</value>

      <value>Players care for and train their puppy by petting it, walking it and buying it supplies to play with. As a puppy competes in obedience and agility trials, owners can win money to purchase other puppy breeds. The pups will vary in gender, coloration and personality. Players purchase one of several breeds available at the beginning, then start spending time with their pup. They throw flying discs and balls to improve the pup’s agility, bathe it when it gets dirty and use their own personal voice commands to train the dog to do tricks. If players train it well enough, they will excel in obedience and agility trials and disc competitions, which will earn money that they can use to buy other supplies and puppy breeds. When players earn enough cash, they can buy even more puppies to live with their original pup. Players can socialize their pups by walking them around the town, where they will meet neighborhood dogs, and maybe even find new toys. Trips to the park and gym offer valuable training time to prepare for agility trials and disc competitions. Over time, the pup's stamina will increase so players can explore farther and farther. Players also can interact wirelessly with their friends' Nintendogs – they can set their DS to bark whenever another puppy is within wireless range. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>(Known in Japan as "Slime Mori Mori Dragon Quest 2")  The hero of this action-adventure is a slime—one of the most popular monsters from the Dragon Quest series. The game is set in the kingdom of Slimenia, a peaceful land that is suddenly invaded by a mysterious cartel called "the Plob," who then proceed to kidnap all the slimes in the capital city of Boingburg. Our protagonist, Rocket, is the only slime left behind, and must embark on a journey throughout Slimenia to save his friends and uncover the Plob's nefarious plot. The adventure stages consist of our hero bouncing and stretching, as well as carrying various objects on his head, while solving the mysteries behind each area, and rescuing his captured slime friends along the way. Simple, streamlined controls allow players of all ages and skill levels to take part in the action with ease. Each adventure stage culminates in Rocket hopping aboard a colossal slime-shaped war machine called the Schleiman Tank and battling it out with the enemy’s Monster Tanks. Customize tanks by collecting a vast array of weapons and items. Call upon allies, each with their own individual personality and abilities, to aid in the heated tank battles. Even shoot your fellow slimes so they can infiltrate and sabotage the enemy’s Monster Tank. Pit tanks against a friend’s in exciting player-vs.-player action, using the Nintendo DS wireless multiplayer game feature. [Square Enix]</value>

      <value>Players care for and train their puppy by petting it, walking it and buying it supplies to play with. As a puppy competes in obedience and agility trials, owners can win money to purchase other puppy breeds. The pups will vary in gender, coloration and personality. Players purchase one of several breeds available at the beginning, then start spending time with their pup. They throw flying discs and balls to improve the pup’s agility, bathe it when it gets dirty and use their own personal voice commands to train the dog to do tricks. If players train it well enough, they will excel in obedience and agility trials and disc competitions, which will earn money that they can use to buy other supplies and puppy breeds. When players earn enough cash, they can buy even more puppies to live with their original pup. Players can socialize their pups by walking them around the town, where they will meet neighborhood dogs, and maybe even find new toys. Trips to the park and gym offer valuable training time to prepare for agility trials and disc competitions. Over time, the pup's stamina will increase so players can explore farther and farther. Players also can interact wirelessly with their friends' Nintendogs – they can set their DS to bark whenever another puppy is within wireless range. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>[DSiWare; Also known as "Art Style: PiCOPiCT"]  Your goal in Art Style: PiCTOBiTS is simple: clear large blocks that fall from above ("megabits") by combining them with "bits" (square blocks) of the same color. Add in the ability to pick up bits and place them anywhere on the touch screen, and you'll quickly find that strategy is critical to your success. By clearing the bits, you gradually reveal each stage's hidden game character - look for favorites from classic NES titles - and earn coins that can be spent to unlock DARK stages or to listen to the game's soundtrack in MUSIC mode. This grand mix of familiar elements and new game play leads to the uniquely enjoyable experience that is PiCTOBiTS. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>Like finding the underlining 'picture' in a 'crossword puzzle', the goal in Picross DS is to fill a grid with squares and crosses in order to 'paint' a picture. Numbers at the head of the puzzles' columns and rows signify how the grids need to be filled out, but it will take a sharp mind to figure out the solution - and some speedy fingers to defeat the competition. The game's main Picross Mode offers a staggering 300 puzzles available to play at your leisure. Ranging from the elementary five by five grids to highly complicated twenty by twenty grids, this mode can keep even the most hardened gamers happy. Those less certain of their skills can opt to receive clues to help finish puzzles, or get a head start with a roulette-style hint function that reveals one line of the puzzle. Bring your individual talents to the table with My Picross Mode, in which you can create your very own puzzles to share with your friends (locally, or via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection). Designing your own puzzles is simplicity itself thanks to the easy-to-use stylus and Touch Screen. For that extra personal flair, you can even design the image beneath the puzzle which is revealed upon completion. A variety of unlockable skins - with themes ranging from nature to sports or video game heroes – give you all the customisation tools you’ll need to make Picross DS fit your style.

The game also allows gamers to build Spirit Card Decks to strategically access power-ups and power-downs to perform special attacks, cast healing spells on themselves, displace opponents, or prohibit them from using their own Spirit Cards. Additionally, gamers can take to the streets battling against enemies with up to four players in fast-paced combat via the Nintendo DS' Wi-Fi capabilities. [Sega]</value>

The game also offers co-op, competitive multiplayer for 1-4 players via local wireless, a powerful level editor tool which allows players to edit in-game levels or create new ones from scratch, and the revolutionary new ability to transfer data among DS systems through sound data transfer technology known as Sound Load. Never before utilized for DS systems, the Sound Load technology in Bangai-O Spirits allows players to transfer level data among DS handheld systems via the use of sound and the DS microphone. This technology works by taking the level data and turning it into a sound file which is output through the host DS speaker. This data is then interpreted through the microphone of the recipient DS, and the level transfer is complete. It is also possible to upload and circulate sound files of level data from Bangai-O Spirits online via the Internet, or to save files to a recording device like a PC or jump drive for transport and distribution, allowing gamers to catalog, share and compare levels online easily with gamers all over the world! Widening the range of play and interaction even further, gamers can also deliver high score and gameplay footage as transferable sound files by using Sound Load. [D3Publisher of America]</value>

Spotto, being the world's foremost Bombirdier, must follow these ghosts to a haunted house and use his trusty bombs to blast the baddies. Take control of Spotto, adjusting his aim with the stylus and trying to toss bombs into the ghosts' mouths in 50 "explosive" stages.

      <value>[DSiWare]  As the '80s were drawing to a close, the developers at Capcom began work on a top-secret project that aimed to set new standards for the platformer genre. That game was called Dark Void. Alas, Capcom suspended development on Dark Void as it began to evaluate the SNES. Before long, the game was shelved and drifted, unnoticed, into the annals of gaming history. Dark Void became a legendary "lost project" at Capcom. Now, nearly 20 years later, Dark Void is back! To commemorate the game's humble origins, Capcom has commissioned this recreation of the original 8-bit classic, now re-titled Dark Void Zero, on the Nintendo DSi system. You play as Rusty, the first human born in the Void, who must take on the Watchers in a quest to stop their domination of Earth. With the aid of Nikola Tesla and his state-of-the-art rocket pack, Rusty must take down the Watchers and their minions across three intense levels of action and intrigue. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>Tokyo is in full lockdown, the government's swift, coldblooded response to a surprise demon invasion. Trapped within the sprawling metropolis is the city's helpless populace, forced to turn on each other in order to survive.  A mysterious piece of technology, the COMP, falls into the hands of you and your peers.  This device allows you to form contracts, forcing demons to serve you in battle against the otherworldly creatures.  There are others with COMPs, so-called demon tamers, who seek to use the demons to satisfy their own whims-be they for justice, peace, or power-in the chaos that was once downtown Tokyo. Where did the demons come from?  Why did they appear?  Who created the COMPs, and what is their purpose?  These questions must soon be answered, for if you fail to solve the mystery, much more is at stake than your own lives. [Atlus USA]</value>

      <value>10 DS players can battle with only one Tetris DS card. Each of the six modes of play features a theme based on a classic Nintendo game, such as Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda or Metroid. The traditional Tetriminos (falling blocks) and line-clearing strategy remain the staples of the game, but the touch screen adds a new element of interactivity. Some modes give players special Tetris puzzles to solve. Others feature head-to-head action between two players, or massive wireless battles between 10 DS users, even if only one player has a game card. Players also can log onto Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to compete in two- or four-player battles. Tetris DS even includes a point-based rating system based on players' battle results. Opponents can see one another's ratings, which indicate their skill levels. Every gamer, whether competitive or casual, will find a way to reconnect with one of the most popular puzzle games in history. Look for more details about the new game play modes on Nintendo.com in the weeks leading up to the game's release. [Nintendo.com]</value>

      <value>Powered by a game engine built exclusively for Nintendo DS that operates at 60 frames per second, FIFA Soccer 09 delivers more responsive, intelligent and realistic physical action. Double the frame rate enables players to move more fluidly around the pitch, react more intelligently to the action and creates a much faster paced game. Players make more intelligent runs, deliver crisp, beautifully placed passes and snap off precision shots. From the moment you step onto the pitch, FIFA Soccer 09 challenges you to think and react like a real player through the popular feature innovation Be A Pro – now debuting on Nintendo DS. Gamers can play over multiple seasons and the mode features the unique Be A Pro camera that tracks your player, re-creating the excitement and rush of racing in on goal. In Be A Pro you choose a professional player or create your own player and then develop his skills in the outfield position of your choice until he becomes a national legend. Every match performance is evaluated in real-time with in-game feedback and a final rating. For the first time play with up to three friends all playing fixed to single players on your favorite club or go head-to-head with a single cart and local multiplayer . [Electronic Arts]</value>

Each has unique moves: Yoshi can eat enemies and turn them into eggs that he can throw; Mario can punch, kick and wall-jump to great heights; super-strong Wario can break certain blocks; and Luigi can jump incredibly high. Power Flowers give each character even cooler powers, like invisibility, fire breath or the power to float through the air. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>(Also known as "Touch! Kirby's Magic Paintbrush")  Kirby: Canvas Curse delivers classic Kirby action with a fun twist. Using the stylus to control Kirby's movements is surprisingly intuitive, and the new control scheme provides many unique gameplay challenges. The rainbow paths you draw guide Kirby through the game, but they also can protect Kirby from falling icicles, lasers, cannon blasts and other hazards. In addition to drawing paths, the stylus can also be used to stun enemies, destroy barriers, detonate bombs and much more. Each of the game's seven worlds is divided into three stages, and each stage holds three hidden medals. Some are easy to find, while others are either well-hidden or heavily protected. You don't need to find these medals to complete the game, but the medals you recover can be traded in to unlock special features like new ink colors for the paths you draw with the stylus.

      <value>In a jam? Well, all these guys DO is jam! Prepare to rock as these beat masters use their groovy moves to save the day. As the music plays, players tap the screen, trace rhythmic patterns and keep the beat as the story unfolds on the top screen. Every scene is accompanied by rump-shaking tunes, but players have to keep the Elite Beat Agents grooving. The worse players do, the worse the story might end up. Whether they’re helping a lost dog find its way home or helping a babysitter charm a hunky football player, no crisis is too weird. The public knows of government agencies like the FBI and CIA, but little is known of this super-secret agency. Code-named Elite Beat Agents, these men in black are heroes' heroes and the coolest group of guys this world has ever known. Of course, according to official records, they do not exist. Their leader, an ex-CIA agent named Commander Kahn, scans the world for cries of help. When he finds one, he dispatches the agents, who assist their targets by performing a song and dance. The hypnotic nature of their rocking revives the targets with "Groovy" energy that boosts their willpower and helps them overcome their obstacles. Every stage is presented in a storyline fashion. All stages share similar basic elements and game flow: The player gets introduced to the target’s problem in a comical intro. Commander Kahn dispatches the agents to the scene. The agents arrive in a special "Beat Transport" that is tailor-made for the situation. The song starts as the agents and player meet the target. By tapping and tracing patterns that appear on-screen, players play along with the song’s rhythm. The animated story changes depending on how well the player performs. After each section, the player gets judged. Depending on the Elite-o-meter's judgment, the story will go well or poorly. If the player makes it though the whole song, he or she will be judged on the whole thing and get one of three endings. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks sets hero Link on a daring new adventure. The game provides players with a new story, more puzzles and even a new mode of transportation. In this game, Link voyages by train, which offers up new possibilities for problem-solving. The game has the same look and feel established in Phantom Hourglass. Link has a valuable new companion. While navigating dungeons, he's accompanied by a Phantom, a hulking suit of armor that responds to his commands. Players can tap the Phantom to take command of him, then draw a line on the touch screen to direct him where to go. The stout Phantom can walk through fire or lava, be used as a platform to carry Link above dangers, or even run interference to block Link from harm. When Link conducts the train, players enjoy a satisfying combination of action and real-time puzzle solving as they determine which track to take and how to best manipulate their speed. When on the train, Link must plot the best route to the end of the line around ever-moving obstacles. While en route, Link might need to fire an onboard cannon at enemies who attack the train or sound the whistle to scare animals off the tracks. Link uses a variety of new items and weapons, including the Whirlwind, which players activate by blowing into the microphone of the Nintendo DS system. As with The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, players can draw notes on the in-game maps using the stylus on the touch screen. [Nintendo]</value>

For example, the Legendary Pokémon Reshiram can only be caught in Pokémon Black Version, while the Legendary Pokémon Zekrom can only be caught in Pokémon White Version. Additionally, the two games feature different areas for the first time in the series, with the game world of Pokémon Black Version featuring a unique metropolitan area called Black City, and a lush, green area named White Forest only found in Pokémon White Version. Pokémon Black Version and Pokémon White Version also mark the first time in a Pokémon video game that the seasons will change in the game world. Certain Pokémon appear more frequently during different seasons, and players can only access some areas during a specific season.</value>

      <value>Developed by Level 5 (the developers of "Dragon Quest VIII," "Dark Cloud" and "Rogue Galaxy") Dragon Quest IX unites the key components that made the previous Dragon Quest titles such as success. Horii and Sugiyama are on board to provide their talents as DQIX takes the series in a decidedly different direction. For the first time, the DQ franchise has an action-oriented title where battles take place on the field (much like "Crystal Chronicles"). To cap off the presentation, SQEX announced that the game supports four-player multiplayer. [Famitsu/Square Enix]</value>

Additionally, the two games feature different areas for the first time in the series, with the game world of Pokémon Black Version featuring a unique metropolitan area called Black City, and a lush, green area named White Forest only found in Pokémon White Version. Pokémon Black Version and Pokémon White Version also mark the first time in a Pokémon video game that the seasons will change in the game world. Certain Pokémon appear more frequently during different seasons, and players can only access some areas during a specific season.</value>

      <value>[Metacritic's 2007 DS Game of the Year]  Many months have passed since the events of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and Link, Tetra and Tetra’s band of pirates have set sail in search of new lands. They come across a patch of ocean covered in a dense fog, in which they discover an abandoned ship. Tetra falls into danger when she explores the ship alone, and Link falls into the ocean when he attempts to rescue her. When he washes up unconscious on the shores of a mysterious island, he is awakened by the sound of a fairy’s voice. With the aid of this fairy, he sets off to find Tetra – and his way back to the seas he once knew. The stylus makes controlling Link easier than ever. Tap on the screen to make Link move, or sweep the stylus around him to swing the sword. Players can even draw a path for his boomerang and send it flying into hard-to-reach targets. Players can stash the map on the top screen for quick reference or drop it to the touch screen to make notes, study enemies, or chart a path for their boat to follow while they man the cannons. Compete with a friend over a local wireless connection: Guide Link through special dungeons to capture the Triforce or command the forces that oppose him. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>In his evil plot to take over the Mushroom Kingdom, Fawful tricks Bowser into eating a magic mushroom. The mushroom causes Bowser to begin inhaling everything around him, including Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach! Do the Mario Bros. have the guts to rescue Peach and escape? Players are in control of two separate storylines. One features Bowser and his efforts to stop an arch-villain from taking over his castle. Meanwhile, inside Bowser, the microbe-sized Mario &amp; Luigi must muscle their way through challenges and keep their nerve if they want to find a way out. They take action to control Bowser from the inside - but without his knowledge. Players can switch between storylines at will. What happens inside Bowser affects what he’s doing on the outside. Sometimes Mario &amp; Luigi must solve puzzles and challenges behind the scenes to help Bowser overcome various obstacles and advance the plot. Players must make well-timed button presses to enhance their performance during battles and challenges. In some battles, Bowser grows so large that players must turn their Nintendo DS or Nintendo DSi system sideways, blow into the microphone or tap on the touch screen with the stylus to keep up with the action. The game features the same hilarious dialogue that has been the hallmark of the Mario &amp; Luigi series. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>One year has passed since Jak and Daxter saved Haven City from Kor and the attacking Metal Heads, yet Haven City is still immersed in deadly chaos as three groups fight for control of the streets. The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland. Jak is flown to the harsh island and dumped. With Daxter and Pecker bravely by his side, the three begin their next adventure where the battle for the city has just begun. Five times the size of Haven City, the Wasteland is a desert environment with multiple areas including mines and a volcano. Given the enormity and variance in terrain, vehicles play a large role as off-road transportation is introduced, fueled by a true-to-life physics engine. With a rugged new look and suited with armor, Jak is also equipped with an arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods that enable players to increase their firepower and enjoy the freedom to strategize and activate their arsenal at any time. As Jak has been exposed to Light Eco, players can now experience Jak's magnificent transformation to Light Jak. With a glowing electric blue aura and a massive wing span, Light Jak introduces new move sets, including the ability to glide great distances, emit an energy to block enemy attack, and power up at anytime, all of which provide the player with a sense of being invincible. Dark Jak also returns with more capabilities, forcing Jak to find a balance between light and dark. [SCEA]</value>

      <value>Star Wars Battlefront II improves upon the original game's single-player experience with open-ended, mission-based objectives inspired from all six Star Wars films. The compelling storyline spans more than 12 new locations, many from Episode III, including volcanic Mustafar and the space battle above Coruscant. All-new classic movie moments complete the Star Wars Battlefront II experience, as players battle within the interior of the Death Star and visit Princess Leia’s blockade runner, the Tantive IV, as seen at the beginning of Episode IV A New Hope. In addition, at certain key moments within the battles, players can feel the Force as a Jedi. For the first time ever, Star Wars Battlefront II players can engage in space combat and, during the same battle, board enemy ships to attack from within. Starting on foot inside a capital ship, players can enter the spacecraft of their choice and travel into space to dogfight with the rival faction. From there, they can dock within the enemy’s capital ship, overtake the ship’s command posts, man its turrets to disable its shields and destroy it from within! Or, they can simply stay inside their own capital ship and defend it from attacks and enemy fire. The choice is theirs. The stellar online play that marked the original Star Wars Battlefront returns even bigger and better for Star Wars Battlefront II. Players can locate their buddies and track their stats as they battle alongside more players than ever (up to 24 on PS2, 32 on Xbox, 64 on Windows). [LucasArts]</value>

Providing players with some additional performance incentives, the MLB franchise introduces the new Progressive Batting Performance feature, which both rewards players for superior performance and penalize them for hitting slumps. Specific to each individual batter, players are rewarded with slight contact bonuses, or punished with slight decreases in contact, based on how that batter that performs beyond his "natural ability" while under user control. Adding to the online feature set, which includes customizable Online League Play with up to 30 teams, scrolling MLB Score Ticker and more, MLB 08 The Show introduces SCOUT (SportsConnect Online User Tracking), which allows gamers to set and store their game preferences on the MLB server, and enables the system to look for a Quick Match with opponents that fits similar competitive criteria.

      <value>Hundreds of years before Lenneth's tale, another saga lies concealed by the gods. The valkyrie Silmeria once served Odin loyally, but after an incident ignited a conflict between them, Odin forcefully reincarnated her as a human. The human soul that would carry her spirit was that of Alicia, Princess of Dipan. Ordinarily, Silmeria’s consciousness would have been sealed, her spirit dormant until she was next summoned... However, the forced transmigration causes Silmeria's spirit to awaken within Alicia, leaving two souls to inhabit a single body. The spirit that should have been sealed has awakened—a situation Odin will not ignore for long. This installment introduces the new Photon Action System to the classic side-scrolling action format found in the original. Projecting photons grants players more freedom to explore and expands the action, resulting in challenging puzzles with clever solutions. Add to that "sealstones" that affect the laws of nature in dungeons, launching strategy to new heights. The unique battle system of the previous game has evolved into the Advanced Tactical Combination Battle System. [Square Enix]</value>

      <value>(Also known as "Ace Combat 5: Squadron Leader")  With more than 50 different licensed planes and an intense storyline extending over 30 missions, players will be put to the ultimate test, including air-to-air combat, air-to-ground fighting, air-to-sea assaults, rescue, recon and much more. Incorporating ultra-realistic beautifully rendered in-game graphics and cinematics along with unparalleled game play; ACE COMBAT 5 goes a step beyond the traditional air combat gaming experience. One of the exciting new features to the sequel includes Wingman Command, where players can issue directives to their wingmen mid-mission to carry out coordinated group attacks. Additionally, the in-game radio communications with the squadron and enemies adds to the realism and intensity of the dynamic battle sequences. In the game's premise, it is September 23, 2010 on distant Sand Island, a small island in the Ceres Ocean that divides the two superpowers, Osea and Yuktobania. An entire military base is on red alert--the 108th Tactical Fighter Squadron intercepted an unidentified aircraft and the entire squadron was decimated. You are a fighter pilot, part of the new squadron that's been called into action to protect your nation of Osea. Now, the story begins to unfold. [Namco]</value>

      <value>Devil May Cry 3 unfolds an earlier chapter in Dante's history, before the original Devil May Cry, to the fateful clash between Sparda's twin sons, divided by the divergence of their chosen paths. Along the way, Dante encounters formidable foes and unusual characters including a mysterious man named Arkham and a female hunter named Lady whose mission is to take down all demons, including Dante. These precursory events disclose the complex roots of Dante's character and reveal insight into his clouded past. In addition to its strong roots, the game increases the intensity of gameplay with a new "style" system, which adds an additional level of depth. Depending on preference, players can choose to use short-range, long-range, defensive or evasive play styles. Each system has its own range of gameplay features and players can choose to power up their favorite style for increased special attack abilities. [Capcom]</value>

      <value>LEGO Star Wars II takes the fun and customization ability of the LEGO play pattern and combines it with the epic story, characters and action from the revolutionary Star Wars: Episodes IV, V and VI. With a unique tongue-in-cheek take on the Original Trilogy, LEGO Star Wars II lets you build and battle your way through your favorite film moments. From Darth Vader's pursuit of Princess Leia aboard her Blockade Runner to Luke's final confrontation with Emperor Palpatine. For the first time ever, characters can get in and out of vehicles, as well as ride creatures. Because it's LEGO style, you can also mix and match the body parts of more than 50 playable characters to create one of millions of possible LEGO Star Wars heroes. And on PS2, Xbox and Windows platforms, a game save from the first LEGO Star Wars can unlock another 50-plus additional characters for Free Play mode -- that's more than 100 total characters. Other exciting additions include free-roaming vehicle levels, the ability to switch ships at will in Free Play mode, cool new character-specific attacks and maneuvers, playable mini-kit vehicles, an adaptive difficulty option and more.

      <value>Enter the world of urban street racing and high performance tuner cars with the latest title in the hit Need for Speed series: Need for Speed Underground. Take on today's most popular tuner cars from Mitsubishi Motors, Subaru, Toyota and many more, building the ultimate street machine by earning cash to pay for custom body kits and a host of licensed car performance mods. But just creating a custom street racing machine will not get you to the top; it takes a certain amount of attitude and razor sharp driving skills to compete in the tough world of urban racing. A number of diverse events set in gritty, nighttime environments make up the heart of street competition. Players become complete street racers by perfecting skills in each event by nailing the perfect shift in drag racing and by putting their street cred on the line, racing through the city streets at all hours of the night. Prove you belong in the elite street racing circles, work your way up the underground rankings and take on the best of the best in each discipline. [Electronic Arts]</value>

      <value>At the beginning of this new adventure, we find Joe and his girlfriend, Silvia, ready to face even tougher enemies and greater challenges. This time around, not only will gamers be able to play as Joe, but as Silvia right off the bat as well. In addition to being equipped with her pompoms, Silvia will be packing some heat as she wields a projectile weapon to help defeat the encroaching evil that lurks in the shadows. Keeping to the stylized yet richly detailed visuals, Viewtiful Joe 2 stays true to its masterfully crafted roots and delivers an even more brilliant and polished videogame. New cinematic visual effect (VFX) powers, such as ?Replay? which allows gamers to repeat a part of the action for heroic results, have been implemented to help solve ingenious puzzles, defeat unique yet relentless enemies and add variety to gameplay: Spanning across an increased number of stages and environments including a jungle, snowy mountains and outer space, Viewtiful Joe 2 incorporates more impressive quasi 2D/3D action with over 40 new types of adversaries to obliterate. The not-so-average-Joe will once again break the gaming mold and deliver an experience unlike any other with his polished martial arts attacks, high-flying acrobatics, and compelling storyline.

Shadow Hearts: Covenant also brings back the innovative combat system, the Judgment Ring, which not only allows players to choose which characters to bring to battle, but also determines the final outcome of the battle based on the players' speed and accuracy. New to the Shadow Hearts sequel, are enhancements to the Judgment Ring which allow team-based combo attacks. Set during World War I in a fantastical world of magic and creatures, the game takes place six months after the original Shadow Hearts ended. Yuri, the main character is back, and he embarks on a new expedition with friends Gepetto, a puppet master, and Kallen, a German female soldier. Yuri's morphing abilities have been weakened because he has been cursed by Nicholas, a member of a secret society taking advantage of the war to fulfill their evil ambitions of ruling the world. Yuri and his companions must journey to find a cure for his curse and defeat the malevolent cult. [Midway]</value>

The stage is set at the burning Honnoji Temple, as the famous Onimusha warrior Samanosuke Akechi (Takeshi Kaneshiro) continues to fight the demons in his path. The moment has finally arrived for Samanosuke to confront the true enemy that has eluded him until now, the undying Nobunaga Oda.

As a member of the French army, Jacques is deployed to the nightmarish scene only to discover himself amid a plague of horrific enemies that are beyond anyone?s imagination. An ancient samurai warrior unexpectedly appears to help him defend the helpless city. As they cooperatively fight off the demons, Jacquesis caught in a mysterious vortex and vanishes to feudal Japan, leaving the warrior behind in modern day France. Why has Samanosuke appeared in present Paris and Jacques in feudal Japan? What fate awaits these two men?

Immerse yourself in a dramatic story: Experience unparalleled depth in storytelling as you fight your way through a twisting tale filled with adrenaline, tension and discovery. Manipulate time to surprise enemies: Execute powerful attacks against entire armies by slowing down or rewinding time, or surprise them by using some all-new Sands of Time powers.

      <value>(Also known as "Katamari Damashii" )  In Katamari Damacy, players take on the role of Prince of the Cosmos, whose father ­ the great King ­ managed to inadvertently knock the stars out of the sky. As the prince, a player's duty is to clean up the King's mess and re-create the starry skies by rolling around the cleverly designed locations to collect objects and build up their 'katamari' -- a Japanese word for clump or large mass. The catch is that it's not the quality or the actual number of objects gathered that is most critical to the player's success, but instead the sheer size of the player's 'katamari' that is most important. Along the way, players can roll over hundreds of unusual objects of all sizes and shapes including cookies, cars, mermaids, planes, clouds and even people. The larger the player's 'katamari' grows, the more objects the player can amass along the way -- thus proving if you want to succeed in Katamari Damacy -- size does matter. Katamari Damacy features a single-player story mode and a two-player battle mode. The simple game play mechanics allow for optimal ball rolling and object collecting fun. [Namco]</value>

      <value>We Love Katamari features the diminutive yet determined Prince with an assortment of celestial cousins and the eccentric King of All Cosmos. The King of All Cosmos grew to stardom after taking all of the Prince's katamaris and replacing the stars. His fans knew no bounds and wished to see more katamaris fill the sky. The King of All Cosmos desired to appease all of their requests and recruited the Prince and his cousins to help. Now they are tasked with rolling up even more clumps, each larger and more different than the one before. In We Love Katamari, players find themselves in various new locations around Earth as the Prince and his cousins roll up different katamaris according to the fans' requests. We Love Katamari continues the series' trademark graphical style and musical excellence with an original soundtrack and hundreds of brand new items including Koi fish, angels and famous Earthly landmarks to roll up. The Prince's celestial rolling has no boundaries; as his katamari grows larger, he can roll up literally everything in his path – from underwater creatures to mountains and even the Eiffel Tower itself! Players can also roll with a friend in the all-new two-player cooperative mode. With each player controlling part of the clump, they will have to devise new strategies and communicate their rolling intentions in a new level of katamari madness. Battle Mode has also returned to We Love Katamari in extended form with three size scopes for competitive rolling action. [Namco]</value>

      <value>Winning Eleven: Pro Evolution Soccer 2007 expands upon the series' realism with faster gameplay, more responsive control and improved artificial intelligence. Players will now make intelligent runs without the ball, identifying opportunities and pointing to where they would like the ball to be delivered. Similarly, the game is now more physical, with defenders jockeying for position and strikers working to turn their opponent as they receive the ball. The game's shooting system has also been refined, letting players take more snap shots, while volleys have been updated for more player control. Players can also enjoy the Beautiful Game in more ways than ever before with new play modes. International Challenge mode lets players compete through four continents of opposition to become a champion, while Random Selection Match lets gamers take the field with a group of players selected at random from a predetermined league or geographic area. The Master League mode returns with more options, allowing players to take complete control of their favorite team and control its destiny for an extended period of time. The game's roster of teams is also expanded with new, fully-licensed international teams for players to use including Argentina, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden, as well as additional club teams.

      <value>Imagine jump shots so real players actually adjust their movement in mid-air based on distance from the hoop and defensive pressure; a passing touch that gives you the control to skirt a defender or start a fast break; and dribble moves that let you jab left, rock right, crossover, spin and much more. It's all happening in NBA 2K3. No other game delivers the physical element of basketball like this. Accurate impact from collisions, especially hard fouls and authoritative dunks; shot blocking with emphasis on precise hand-to-ball contact; and the ability to lunge for the loose ball, even if it means ending up on some celebrity's lap. With commentators that analyze strategy, cutscenes portraying lifelike player interaction, uniforms that move like real fabric, and a brand new ESPN broadcast system that wraps it all together, NBA 2K3 provides the complete NBA experience.

      <value>ESPN NFL Football brings the complete NFL experience. Whether it's by making an opponent lose his shorts from a stop-and-go juke, by scraping your toes down as you make an acrobatic first-down catch along the sideline, or by piling on top of a swarming gang tackle on fourth and short -- you will truly feel everything that makes the National Football League so intense. Don't look. Don't listen. Feel.</value>

      <value>Rock the Rhythm, Lead, and Bass Guitar tracks in the follow-up sequel to "Guitar Hero." Form your guitar duo and shred riffs cooperatively or go head to head in all new multiplayer modes. With over 55 tracks to rock out to, you'll go from Guitar Hero to Guitar god in one press of a fret button. Choose from multiple rock characters and jam at concert venues that grow in size as your rock career progresses. You'll start your rock career playing small clubs and bars, but if you play well you'll work your way up to stadiums and arenas. Guitar Hero II takes the guitar rock experience to new volumes by allowing players to play 3 different guitar tracks: Rhythm, Bass, and Lead. Guitar Hero II introduces all new multiplayer modes like: cooperative, pro-face off, and face off, letting 2 Guitar Heroes conduct their own symphonies of destruction. Shred School: Guitar Hero II features an all new practice mode, allowing Guitar Zeroes to become Guitar Heroes with enough practice. [RedOctane]</value>

      <value>The story takes place in a world called "Ivalice," in an age when magic was commonplace and airships plied the skies - the Archadian Empire, seeking to strengthen its base of power, had been invading and subjugating its neighboring lands one by one- a fate which befell the small Kingdom of Dalmasca. Archadia's invasion and the subsequent death of the Dalmascan king prompted the Princess Ashe, the sole surviving heir to the Dalmascan throne, to take up arms against the invaders. In her struggle to oust the occupying Archadian forces and restore freedom to her people, Ashe must watch as many of her allies pay the blood price for that freedom. Though tempted to abandon all hope in the face of the Empire's might, her determination keeps her from succumbing before what would seem to be inevitable defeat. Then she meets Vaan, an urchin from the Dalmascan capital of Rabanastre. Vaan dreams of one day becoming a sky pirate, escaping the Empire on his airship. Vaan, Ashe, Vaan's friend Penelo, the sky pirate Balthier, his partner Fran and many more are on an adventure through Ivalice that traces the mysteries behind the Archadian Empire's invasion. Bringing with it a wide array of new gameplay elements, Final Fantasy XII will change the way players think about the Final Fantasy series. Numerous possibilities abound within each scenario, allowing for a less linear, more unique experience for each player. The game also supports Dolby Pro Logic II both in-game and during movie sequences, immersing the player in the middle of the action. [Square Enix]</value>

      <value>[Metacritic's 2007 PS2 Game of the Year]  God of War saw Kratos, a mortal warrior, set upon an epic quest to dethrone a God. But his journey did not end there. In God of War II, Kratos sits atop his Olympus throne, as the new God of War – far more ruthless than Ares ever was. To end his continued torment, Kratos must journey to the far reaches of the earth and defeat untold horrors and alter that which no mortal, or god has ever changed, his fate. God of War II sets an epic stage for a devastating mythological war to end all wars. In God of War II, players retake the role of Kratos. Armed with the deadly blades and blistering rage, players are aided by new breath-taking magic and new brutal combat moves. The journey takes them through vividly striking environments where they are faced with a labyrinth of challenging puzzles and mini-games intricately woven into the story. The violent world of Greek mythology comes to life in gory detail as Kratos encounters new mythical characters, and compete in epic boss battles in his quest. [SCEA]</value>

      <value>[Metacritic's 2002 PS2 Game of the Year ] Welcome to Vice City. Welcome to the 1980s. Having just made it back onto the streets of Liberty City after a long stretch in maximum security, Tommy Vercetti is sent to Vice City by his old boss, Sonny Forelli. They were understandably nervous about his re-appearance in Liberty City, so a trip down south seemed like a good idea. But all does not go smoothly upon his arrival in the glamorous, hedonistic metropolis of Vice City. He's set up and is left with no money and no merchandise. Sonny wants his money back, but the biker gangs, Cuban gangsters, and corrupt politicians stand in his way. Most of Vice City seems to want Tommy dead. His only answer is to fight back and take over the city himself. Vice City offers vehicular pleasures to suit every taste. For the speed enthusiast, there's high-performance cars and motorbikes. For the sportsman, a powerboat or a golf buggy lets you enjoy the great outdoors. For those that need that sense of freedom and escape, why not charter a helicopter and see the beauty of Vice City from the air? [Rockstar]</value>

        Since the incident on Shadow Moses Island, Metal Gear's top-secret technology has been leaked into the black market through the machinations of Revolver Ocelot. As a result, countless variations of Metal Gears have sprung up in every corner of the globe, making the weapon an increasingly common component of the armed forces of nuclear powers.
      </value>
      <value>In the midst of all of this, Solid Snake, now a member of the anti-Metal Gear group "Philanthropy," has learned that a new prototype Metal Gear has been developed by the U.S. Marines and is being transported in secret to an unknown destination. To learn more about this new machine, Snake must infiltrate the transport, disguised as a tanker, as it makes its way down the Hudson River. Just as Snake is about to begin his mission, however, the ship is seized by a mysterious and well-armed group bent on stealing the new Metal Gear for their own, nefarious purposes. [Konami]</value>

      <value>An ambitious and unethical scientist, a secret experiment gone horribly awry, and an artificially intelligent supercomputer gone mad; all the necessary ingredients for the imminent extinction of mankind. You are humanity's last hope, a hotshot pilot given the unenviable task of flying an experimental fighter into the dark heart of the Con-Human Network.

RayCrisis: Series Termination is the final entry in Taito's acclaimed trilogy of shooters, and it bombards your CRT with an abundance of fourth-generation optical stimulation: multilevel scrolling, transparency and lighting effects, and enough polygons to overload your cerebral cortex.

Prepare your senses, reinforce your nerves, and limber your trigger finger - the final assault has begun!</value>

        They've travelled millions of miles, across the galaxies, their mission was simple, "Pose as stupid creatures and study the habitat". The sheep soon forgot their mission and preferred instead to enjoy the sunshine and wallow in the lush green pastures. Now it's time for them to return home. Your task is to guide the Sheep back to their celestial ancestors, saving them from the perils of electric fences, shark-infested ice cream and combine harvesters. It's not as easy as it sounds, especially when your sheep flock off in the other direction!

      <value>In a fantastic world divided by class and race, technology from a mysterious source has imbued a young prince with the key to unimaginable power. By means of a Neural Network Computer fueled by the grey matter of unfortunate 'volunteers', he plans to conquer the known world, replacing it with a new order of his design. The only fly in the ointment is disturbing reports of two powerful Elementals storming across the land on a direct course toward the palace. One or two players can assume the identities of these Elementals as they crusade for an unknown master toward a climactic battle. The gripping story unfolds by means of heart-stopping fully-3D action levels interspersed with gorgeous hand-drawn animation scenes. This is the game for which VISA was invented--what are you waiting for?</value>

      <value>Grab your oxygen mask and jump into the future of interplanetary defense. The year is 2219AD, and Earth's Star Federation has unleashed the R-GRAY advanced tactical combat fighter to save the planet from certain destruction at the hands of the bloodthirsty Secilia Federation. Despite impossible odds, you must now command a specially outfitted R-Gray fighter to defend Earth from certain destruction. Each fighter is equipped with lock-on lasters, pulse lasers, and a single devastating assault laser array that can destroy all sighted targets as once. Even with this technology at your disposal, the battle will not be easy. Earth's forces are depleted, and the merciless hordes of Secilia will settle for nothing less than complete annihilation of Earth. Fortunately, Star command has created two R-GRAY prototypes, so if you need extra firepower, a skilled friend can fly at your side. Whether you fly solo or with a friend, the intense sound, action, and arcade-perfect Hyper-3D visuals will blow you away!</value>

Huge worlds, in-depth storylines, and innovative battle and magic systems, and an incredible cast of characters all make for a deep gaming experience.

      <value>Sequel to the early PlayStation RPG. As a member of the Alliance, a military force only really hinted at in the original, you play the unwitting hero of the game: an orphan who has been raised by a quiet, unassuming battle hero in a seemingly ancient war. Alongside you in the ranks is your best friend Jowy, a boy born of nobility but who has never been able to receive approval in his stubborn father's eyes. As the game begins, you are immediately tossed into a tale of political strife, betrayal and war on a grand scale beyond your scope in the early stages. As the game wears on, the plot will twist, turn and develop in numerous ways that expose the personalities of each of the characters involved. The battle system is turn-based, with the option to equip Runes for special abilities, combine party member attacks to create chain combos or devastating spells, and the option to run the battle in Auto mode.</value>

      <value>We've devised a weapon that's deadlier than a smart bomb. It's called a smart pilot. Now, Ace Combat 2 pits you against a whole squadron of them - 3-D polygonal jet jocks that maneuver like the real deal, turning every scorching sortie and dogfight into a kill-or-be-killed situation. With nearly double the missions of its predecessor, you'll double your chances of taking out the enemy. (Or taking a heat-seeker up the exhaust.)</value>

      <value>When these games came out, they defined what adventures should be. Since then, they have become the most popular and sought-after titles in history.

      <value>Ready or not, the terror of Resident Evil 2 is here.  In chapter one, the case of the disastrous T-virus outbreak--a mutagenic toxin designed for biological weapons--was eventually closed but the experiments were far from over.  Control the destiny of Leon Kennedy or Claire Redfield as their nightmare begins when a biotech terror runs rampant in Raccoon City.  Relentless zombies and hideous monsters are all out for a taste of your blood.  If the suspense doesn't kill you, something else will.</value>

      <value>Featuring a storyline developed by the creator of Chrono Trigger and Xenogears, Chrono Cross has been christened the "Best RPG Creation" by its development team. With multiple scenarios cast along a single story thread, and many different endings, each replay can result in an entirely new adventure. In addition, a brand new battle system makes combat smooth and innovative by introducing an element field system and combo system that gives the player unparalleled flexibility in their fighting options. The elimination of random battles also quickens the pace of the game, and places the choice of where to battle in the player's hands. With character designs by a famed Japanese illustrator and music by the original Chrono Trigger composer, Chrono Cross features visuals and sounds that bring its magic to life.</value>

      <value>FIFA Soccer 10 Wii is an over-the-top, non-stop soccer game that is designed exclusively for the platform. A polished gameplay experience that emphasizes action, approachability and responsiveness has been created that contains various key gameplay improvements and innovations. Shooting has been refined for improved shot power, accuracy and the ability to score from a greater range of distances and angles. Passing has been refined for faster and more accurate execution, while improved pass targeting and AI logic will create more open spaces and generate greater scoring opportunities. Goalkeepers will be more responsive when positioning themselves for a save, while still allowing for juicy rebounds adding to the non-stop soccer theme. The defending AI has also been reworked to allow for more urgency in the 18 yard box, meaning more block attempts and better player positioning to provide better team defensive coverage. When packaged together these gameplay improvements will keep the action fast and furious on the pitch. [Electronic Arts]</value>

      <value>[WiiWare]  The village residents are hungry for the latest in foliage fashion, and it's up to you, the new barber, to fix them up. Use the tools of your trade: scissors, clippers, spray can, and more in this humorous, first-of-its-kind "first-person-groomer" game. Bonsai Barber features a colorful cast of 12 intriguing customers, including a temperamental shallot starlet (don't call her an onion), an oddball strawberry boffin, a cactus cowboy, a daredevil carrot, and a suave banana with top-secret clearance. Each day, five customers arrive to test your stylistic skill. If the customer requests a specific style, you'll plow that furrow, or you can rely on your expertise to pick from more than 30 popular fashions. Or, why not turn over a new leaf? Be creative and see how they react. They're a demanding bunch, so if you miss an appointment, you'll hear about it-on your Wii Message Board. If you do a good job, you may receive a gift or even a postcard from an exotic destination as your happy customers travel to distant lands and show off their exquisite coifs. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>Tennis (1-4 players): Players grab the controller like a racket and swing – the game will register forehands, backhands, volleys, lobs, slices, spin and power depending on how fast the user swings and at what angle. Don't worry about moving around the court to get to the ball – the game automatically moves players into position. Baseball (1-2 players): Grip the controller like a bat and swat fastballs out of the park in a home run derby. Timing and bat speed will make all the difference between going yard and whiffing, so keep an eye on the ball and swing for the fences. In the two-player game, one player pitches and the other bats. Golf (1 player): Step up to the tee, hold the controller like a golf club and swing naturally to smack the ball onto the green. The harder players swing the club, the farther the ball will fly, so be sure to take some practice swings before going for the pin. After reaching the green, line up putts carefully, practice the stroke and try to hole out. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>[WiiWare]  Art Style: light trax takes racing to whole new (and very surreal) levels as you control a white beam of light moving perpetually forward while your viewpoint shifts between 2-D and 3-D perspectives. Start by choosing one of the two main modes of game play, each with its own distinct goal. In light tours mode, you vie with other light beams for the most points in a three-course racing tour. Watch out for obstacles, use items and strategically use your dash ability to finish first. In freeway mode, your objective is to set a high score by traveling the greatest distance within a set amount of time. Mastering the intricacies of each setting is crucial: you'll have to alternate between them in order to progress through the game and unlock all of its modes. With precise controls packed in and a driving techno soundtrack, Art Style: light trax offers an experience unlike any other. Are you ready to compete in a mind-bending race at the speed of light? Games in the Art Style series feature elegant design, polished graphics and pick-up-and-play controls, creating an experience focused purely on fun and engaging game play.</value>

      <value>[WiiWare] Charming. Suave. Awesome. These are the words Strong Bad would use to describe himself. In a world gone mad, only one man can be trusted to save the day. A man with an attitude. A man called Strong Bad. As the star of the Homestar Runner Web cartoons, Strong Bad has been answering e-mails (in boxing gloves), pranking his friends, pummeling his enemies, and making people with questionable taste snort milk out of their noses for years now. And he's branched out to star in Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People, a monthly five-episode series. In Episode 1: Homestar Ruiner, Strong Bad's plans to beat the snot out of Homestar backfire, and he ends up with an unwanted houseguest cramping his style. Now he needs to get life back to normal by any means possible. But wait, there's more: Teen Girl Squad comics, achievements, funny costumes and arcade games. You can even send pictures and messages to Wii Friends using Strong Bad's computer. So how about it? Can you handle Strong Bad's style? [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>In Harvest Moon: Animal Parade, the divine tree which once stood in the middle of the Harvest Goddess' pond is weakening, the creatures are beginning to leave the land, and the five bells have lost their power. The Harvest Goddess believes that only the strength of the Harvest King can help revive the earth and bring the tree back to life. It's up to the player to help the Harvest Sprites ring the five mystical bells, summon the Harvest King, and revive the Harvest Goddess' tree and the land. Players find plenty of activities in Harvest Moon: Animal Parade, including cultivating crops and caring for wild and exotic animals such as penguins, pandas, and monkeys. Players can take their exotic animals out for walks, teach them tricks, and even ride some of them around town! When the circus rolls into town, players also need to help the ringmaster find the escaped animals. Befriend the lion, giraffe, and hippopotamus to save the show! The game also lets players take and share pictures over WiiConnect24. Players can take pictures of their farm, their family, or their village and show them off online. [Natsume]</value>

Take over the Big Apple in this fully interactive open-world games based on the classic film by Paramount Pictures and the critically-acclaimed book by Mario Puzo. The game offer brand new ways to go from Soldier to Don as you gain control of the streets of New York. Follow the path of an Enforcer or Operator; each with its own unique perks and abilities to earn. Now you can chat up specific characters to get the skinny on dirty cops, take down two additional revised compounds of rival Families, execute five new contract hits, and call in larger Corleone Hit Squads when the going gets tough. For improved, hyper-intuitive Blackhand Control in The Godfather Blackhand Edition, use gestures with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to really beat down your opposition, or point directly at the screen using the Wii Remote for pinpoint firearm accuracy.

      <value>High-speed action. Robotic insect and animal racers. Wii Wheel controls. Bowling, poker, clowns - and sandwiches! Add them all together and you get the wild, nonstop fun of Excitebots: Trick Racing. This game takes the big-air thrills and simple pick-up-and-play controls of Excite Truck and ramps up the fun with a constant barrage of funky challenges and mini-games performed at blinding speed. Players shoot goals, throw pies and even play poker in the middle of rowdy races around off-road tracks. Having your vehicles drive, walk or fly around the track quickly is one thing, but it's more important to go around in style. Players earn stars for huge jumps, cool tricks and daring feats at high speed. Six players can race online via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection in both Excite Race and Poker Race modes. If friends can't join online, players can exchange ghost data via WiiConnect24 and challenge their friends to outdo their most daring tricks. [Nintendo]</value>

With a unique tongue-in-cheek take on the original adventures, LEGO Indiana Jones follows Dr. Jones escapades through the jungles of South America to the mountaintops of India. Fans can build, battle and brawl their way through their favorite cinematic moments, from Indy's entanglements with snakes to his dashing boulder run. Pop culture's most iconic archeologist whips through all the classic moments with the help of a host of supporting characters including Marion Ravenwood and Short Round. Players can also mix and match the body parts of more than 60 playable characters to create new heroes just as they could in the LEGO Star Wars games. [LucasArts]</value>

      <value>[WiiWare]  Join the Flight Club to take to the skies and experience a variety of aerial activities. Take off and pilot a biplane through rings along a predetermined flight path, or drift serenely in a hang glider, catching thermal currents to gain altitude. In either case, just be sure to stick the landing. Looking for more speed? Strap on the rocket belt to blast your way around an obstacle course. If that's not enough, reach maximum velocity as you tackle a skydiving lesson at 3,800 feet. Complete specific objectives within a set time limit to score points (and maybe even a bonus chance) and obtain certification in eight different lessons. Your goals will become more challenging, and weather conditions will make controlling your vehicle more difficult as you progress. If you succeed, you will be rewarded with the opportunity to pilot an attack helicopter on a daring rescue mission. It's time to earn your wings. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>Donkey Kong Jungle Beat originally debuted on the Nintendo GameCube system. This new version has been remastered with motion controls, new enemies and obstacles, and a new final boss battle. Nintendo also has added special monkeys to each stage that give tips or let players save their progress. The new controls make this well-reviewed game accessible to new players while giving those who played the original new challenges. The goal of the game is to guide Donkey Kong through beautifully rendered stages like lava caves, tempestuous oceans and even a ninja-chimp fortress. Racing through the game will get players to the goal, but the real skill comes from helping Donkey Kong perform multiple mid-air acrobatic moves as he collects bananas in each stage. The more sweet moves he does in a row, the more bonus bananas he gets at the end of the stage. To become the king of the jungle, he must team up with animal friends and defeat multiple contenders in boxing matches. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>In a frantic battle to the checkered flag, Sonic and friends speed around tracks set in medieval castle ramparts, lush rainforests and bustling cities, all taken from the visually rich and varied universes of Sonic and SEGA. Fan favorites such as Dr. Eggman, Tails, AiAi, Amigo and many more will join Sonic in their custom built vehicles, revving their engines and jostling to stay ahead of the pack. Each character will speed around the track in cars, planes, motorbikes, and in Aiai’s case – a banana mobile! Secret short cuts, swift handling and avoiding strategically placed obstacles are certainly the best way to get to the top of the podium. But winning is only part of the fun in Sonic &amp; SEGA All-Stars Racing! Each character has a specific All Star move – such as Super Sonic, Banana Blitz and Tails Tornado – that allows a quick way for competitors to get back into the race! Power ups and weapons can also be collected around the tracks and used against the opposition to ensure they don’t become a threat to that number one position. [Sega]</value>

Stand together with your friends – both in the game and in the living room – and you will be able to conquer the madness that fame brings. Go on a globetrotting adventure with Shaun White as your partner – Ubisoft worked in close contact with Shaun White in order to infuse the experience with the most authentic elements of his riding style, personality and sense of humor. Shaun will act as a good-natured friend and mentor to the player, hooking him up with the right friends to conquer challenges together, introduce him to new locales, or simply be around to share in a laugh.

Control your carves, jumps and grinds with the intuitiveness and fun of having a snowboard in your own living room. Engage in a seamlessly integrated multiplayer experience for two to four players, where every player is active in the game at all times. Getting your name out there by doing well as a pro snowboarder is bound to get you some recognition. As your fame grows, so too does your ability to take on bigger and bigger challenges, from new mountains to more prestigious events and competitions. Fame, however, isn’t everything. You’ll need to gain your friends’ respect by riding with style in order to gain their support; they will help you find hidden areas, share their favorite music tracks and keep you laughing.

      <value>The House of the Dead: Overkill charges you with mowing down waves of infected, blood-thirsty zombies in a last-ditch effort to survive Bayou City and uncover the horrific truth behind the origins of The House of the Dead. A pulp-style take on the classic SEGA light-gun shoot 'em up franchise. Back when the famous Agent G was still fresh out of the academy, he teamed up with hard-boiled bad-ass Agent Washington to investigate stories of mysterious disappearances in small-town Louisiana. Little did they know what blood-soaked mutant horror would await them in the streets and swamps of Bayou City. Pulp Funk Horror - Zombie cool, one of the most popular shooter classics injected with a whole new retro b-movie look. An utterly in-your-face zombie-dismembering blast. Non-stop light-gun style action on Wii, blow apart zombies for high-score thrills. Co-op action on Wii. Bring a friend and play the game as intended in your own buddy action movie as two of the meanest mofos in video gaming. Relentless, gore-drenched, over-the-top action - Only the coolest, most cold-hearted agent’s going to keep his head against the zombie flood. Use "Slow-Mofo Time" to make the perfect head-popping shot and "Evil Eye" to spot moments of opportunity that’ll send the whole environment up in flames. Wiimote reactions. Get knee-deep in the dead with motion-sensitive Wii-controls. Shuck a shotgun and when the zombies get too close, pistol whip jaws off or cave some heads in with the stock of your pump-action - all in stomach-churning close-up. [Sega]</value>

      <value>While the game shares its twisting plot with the original PlayStation game, Silent Hill: Shattered Memories takes a different path in many, many ways. Characters can be approached but offer different responses and be found in different places, while new clues and gameplay paths can be followed. The title follows Harry Mason, as he attempts to unravel the mystery of his missing daughter, Cheryl. A broken man, Mason’s investigations lead him to the mist-shrouded, snowy streets of Silent Hill: a malevolent town where the shadows play host to a wealth of evil, misshapen creatures. Designed to make full use of the Wii's unique controllers, Silent Hill: Shattered Memories uses the Wii Remote as a torch and cell phone as Mason looks for clues. The torch is vital for scouring the darkened, abandoned buildings of Silent Hill, while the phone acts as a secondary user interface, allowing the player to access maps via its GPS capabilities and take pictures of interesting elements. Likewise, the Wii Remote also can be used to pick up, examine and manipulate items to solve puzzles along the journey. Such technology was not available when the original Silent Hill was released in 1999, and its inclusion showcases Konami’s determination to enhance the playing experience with new, available technology. Also new to Shattered Memories is a psyche profile element, which monitors every aspect of player’s reactions - from where they explore first, items that have been examined, and their reaction to those they meet. Small visual elements will also be altered slightly, adding to the oppressing atmosphere where nothing is what it seems. The psyche profile will adapt Harry’s actions as and when he meets normal-looking people or the game's many inhuman denizens. [Konami]</value>

      <value>[WiiWare]   Toki Tori is his name, and collecting eggs is his game. In this puzzle/platform game, players use a variety of items such as the Telewarp, InstantRock and Slug Sucker. Clever use and combination of these items are needed to solve all the game's levels, of which there are more than 70. Levels range from easy to brain-teasingly hard, resulting in dozens of hours of puzzle play time. Toki Tori makes the most of what Wii has to offer. It uses the Wii Remote for a unique control scheme, which offers players a new and more relaxing play style. A second player can help you out by drawing hints while you are playing. The game even uses the Wii Message Board in a unique way. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>[WiiWare]  Experience a unique combination of strategy and skill as you maintain a level playing field in the physics-based action puzzler You, Me, and the Cubes. The action centers around Fallos, mysterious creatures that resemble humans and have an ability to balance on a playing field of 3-D cubes. First, create a pair of Fallos inside your Wii Remote™ controller by shaking it up and down. Next, determine suitable places for the Fallos to land, then fling them to the selected cube with a swinging motion. After that, the Fallos are on their own. If your placement is sound, the Fallos will remain stable and you'll clear the stage after tossing a required number onto the cubes. But if the weight or locations of Fallos causes the cubes to tilt and sway too much, the Fallos will lose their balance and fall off. Adding to the challenge, you'll find that some cubes have different properties, making tosses tricky and further threatening the stability of the Fallos. Guide Fallos through dozens of single-player stages or invite family and friends to join you in two-player cooperative mode. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>The game looks at the classic franchise from a new perspective: While much of the game is reminiscent of 2-D side-scrollers, players can switch the perspective into 3-D at any time as they explore the twisting passages of a derelict space station and delve deep into a cinematic, never-before-told story of bounty hunter Samus Aran's past. This new approach uses a new control scheme in which players use the Wii Remote  controller held sideways to battle enemies and navigate the expansive, gorgeous environments in classic Metroid  fashion, then aim at the screen with the Wii Remote pointer to blast foes in first-person and hunt the world for clues and hidden passages.

Our hero encounters a surprising band of castaways, including the long-lost explorer Coronado De Cava. Can the Mighty Pirate win the suspicious De Cava's trust? Will sexy pirate hunter Morgan LeFlay prove to be a ruthless enemy or an unlikely ally? Will the group find La Esponja Grande in time to save Elaine from the rampant Pox of LeChuck? And will the world be crushed by the gnashing teeth of a certain demonic skull? Tales of Monkey Island's moist and absorbing third episode, "Lair of the Leviathan," will answer some of these urgent questions and raise even more as the five-month adventure builds to its epic climax.

BIT.TRIP CORE adds up to an exciting action/rhythm game that's best played while zoning out on the tunes and letting the visuals swallow you whole. The experience is inspired by games from the '80s, but with a modern twist. The game play is entirely new to the series, leaving the single-axis controls of BIT.TRIP BEAT behind in favor of the ability to control two axes. If the difficulty gets you down, grab a friend and play cooperatively with two-player multiplayer. Make it to the end and you'll have journeyed one step further to completing your BIT.TRIP.

      <value>Step onto the pitch and play a unique football experience exclusively for the Wii. Enjoy FIFA 09 All-Play one of two ways—a Wii-specific take on the classic ‘11 vs. 11’ simulation or over-the-top arcade action with Wii versions of your favorite football superstars. FIFA 09 All-Play is perfectly balanced for gamers of any ability to enjoy fun, football action. Choose to play the style that best suits your skills from advanced controls for experienced players to new EA SPORTS All-Play that enables novice players to focus on fun using simplified controls with AI assistance. EA SPORTS All-Play makes it easier and less intimidating for new players to play at their own level of ability. One gesture and one button press performs all the actions and increases your success rate on shots, free kicks and rebounds. Trouble deciding who to pass the ball to? Let the CPU point you in the right direction with on-screen pass indicators and one-button actions. Panic over picking the corner? Don’t worry, just blast away to find the back of the net with instant shots on goal. Plus, the game provides feedback and stats to track your progress. Experienced players using advanced controls can still access all the in-depth controls, now with refined gestures and a precision passing system with point-and-play control. Plus, you can even use a Classic controller or Nintendo GameCube controller for a more traditional FIFA game experience. Play with your Mii alongside your heroes Ronaldinho, Wayne Rooney and other football stars created as customized characters in an arcade version of the beautiful game. Play 8 vs 8 Footii Match mode for addictive pick-up-and-play arcade action suitable for all levels of ability. Steal the ball and make outrageous shots by simply waving your Wii Remote. You’ve never played football like this before! Plus, Footii Party Games called Table Football and Boot It have been overhauled for more great fun with family and friends. [Electronic Arts]</value>

      <value>In a boy and his blob, an evil emperor has seized the throne of Blobolonia, and the fate of its inhabitants lies in the hands of the blob and a young boy he encounters when he crash lands on Earth. Playing the part of the boy, gamers must work together with their new blob friend to solve puzzles, defeat monsters, and escape danger on Earth and Blobolonia. By feeding the blob jelly beans, players can activate his special abilities to transform him into helpful tools - including a ladder, trampoline, parachute, cannon, shield and many more.  Every different blob form aids the boy as he navigates 40 side-scrolling levels filled with hidden treasures and unlockable bonus content on the way to the Emperor's Citadel. Classic beans such as Licorice Ladder, Apple Jack, and Tangerine Trampoline, are joined by all-new jellybeans, including Bubble Gum Bubble and Caramel Cannon to provide a brand new play experience that only Wii can provide!

      <value>Wii Sports Resort is a collection of fun sports games that anyone can pick up and play. This sequel to the popular Wii Sports makes use of the Wii MotionPlus accessory, which gives players the most responsive and realistic experience possible. The Wii MotionPlus accessory, which is included with Wii Sports Resort, plugs into the base of the Wii Remote controller and, combined with the accelerometer and sensor bar, provides an experience that gives players an even greater sense of immersion. Just as with Wii Sports, people compete against friends and family. As the competition heats up, Wii Sports Resort is as much fun to watch as it is to play. First-time players should find it easy to pick up a Wii Remote and jump into the action. Wii Sports Resort takes place on a tropical island. A wide range of activities keep players coming back for one more round. Some sample activities include Sword Play, Power Cruising (racing a water scooter) and Disc Dog, which involves accurately tossing a disc to a cute, Mii-like dog. [Nintendo]</value>

Armed with your magical warhammer and a trusty shield, you must defeat fantastic bosses including a Chimera, Beholder, and a Dragon. The game is a series of epic boss-battles. There are no 'fodder' enemies – its all bosses — the most fun part of games. Each boss has unique abilities and powers. Exploit the weakness of each enemy by jumping, dodging, or shield blocking with the proper timing and agility. Then unleash your rage and decimate your enemy with your warhammer, and you will triumph. [Ghostfire Games]</value>

      <value>Based on ancient Japanese lore, Murumasa: The Demon Blade plunges players into the mystical Genroku era, ruled by the skilled shogun Tsunayoshi Tokogawa. But this culture is threatened; Tokogawa’s thirst for power leads to a conflict over the enormously powerful, though cursed, Demon Blades. Used in hatred, drenched in blood, the cursed blades condemn those who use them to tragedy, madness, and untimely deaths. As chaos spreads, denizens from the netherworld breach their realm as these malevolent swords summon evil spirits - and the Dragon and Demon Gods as well. Featuring hand-drawn 2D art reflecting the heritage and tone of the storyline, Muramasa: The Demon Blade transports players into a little known mythology, envisioned by the creators of the critically acclaimed Odin Sphere. Players take on the role of a male ninja or female kunoichi, utilizing their ninja prowess to traverse the clever side-scrolling levels that feature vertical progression as well as the traditional horizontal stage advancement.

Innovative rushing controls give you a game-breaking ground attack featuring all-new jukes, cutbacks, and the distinct running styles of your favorite backs. Conceived as an entirely original football experience on the Wii, the game puts players on the field like never before. Using the console’s unique remote to pass, kick, snap, throw, catch and run, players interact with the game in an entirely new way. Boasting massive gameplay innovations inspired by the motion sensor of the remote, Madden NFL 07 maximizes the power and unique design of the game system. [Electronic Arts]</value>

      <value>MadWorld is a game with highly stylized black and white graphics, over-the-top violence and visceral action which incorporating a layer of unexpected, irreverent comedy that makes the experience unlike any other. In MadWorld, Varrigan City is under siege by a terrorist group simply known as "The Organizers." They have isolated its citizens from the rest of the world, and have turned the city into a bizarre and twisted game show environment called "Death Watch." In this game of survival, all the citizens have become reluctant contestants and they are pitted against unknown enemies in the ultimate battle of life or death, where only the strongest will prevail. As Jack, players make their way through the various levels and environments in Varrigan City, crafting clever traps and using various weapons – chainsaws, street signs, and daggers, to name a few – to destroy enemies who threaten their lives. The Wii Remote and Nunchuk are used in a variety of motions that mimic the action on screen. Lively sports commentators call out moves as players execute them, and darkly comical finishing moves add a level of irreverence that contributes to the game's unique tone. Along with the exaggerated characters, upbeat pace and bloody visuals that define "Death Watch," a variety of crazed mini-games called "Blood Bath Challenges" are scattered among the levels, giving players a chance to upgrade weapons and increase overall scores.

      <value>(Also known as "Anno 1404: Dawn of Discovery" and "Anno: Create a New World")  Dawn of Discovery takes place in the year 1404, when King George's land is suffering from severe droughts and brutal famine. Aware of his people's distress, the king calls on his two sons, William and Edward, to acquire new territories in order to produce enough goods to satisfy the needs of his empire’s inhabitants. Whereas Edward suggests aggressive means to collect the precious resources, his brother William offers a peaceful solution, proposing to explore new and unsettled lands in the south of the kingdom. With his Father’s blessing, William heads south to the mysterious Orient and returns with valuable new technologies such as the water pump that allows dry lands to be cultivated in order to produce enough food for the people. But there are still many unmet needs within the king's empire, and players are tasked with the mission of fulfilling those needs while both expanding and sustaining the vast society. Build and sustain your own expansive empire. Explore the beautifully detailed world and discover new places to create your civilization. Set up trade posts in the spice mines of the Orient and explore new trade routes to keep your nation growing. Learn from other nearby cultures to expand your horizons and master the challenges of establishing a prosperous society. [Ubisoft]</value>

      <value>As de Blob, the player uses the city as a playground by rolling and bouncing through the streets crushing as many Leech Bots as possible. The Leech Bots are the machines/creatures that extract color from the city and carry this "liquid color" inside them. To restore color to the city de Blob crushes the Leech Bots, absorbs the pigment they carry, and uses the pigment/paint to color everything it touches. de Blob is forced to take on the evil INKT Corporation agents who want the world devoid of color because "color is a crime!" Constantly under attack, the Blob in his own quirky way fights back. Rolling, bouncing and crushing are his weapons. The object is to color and/or stencil as many buildings in the city as possible while avoiding the enemy. Race against time moving at Blob speed, or choose your own pace. The city is a canvas and de Blob is your paint brush! Vast cityscapes and urban sprawl offers players the freedom to explore and make their own game-experience. Complete levels as a fun, animated superhero who transforms a hostile city into a vibrant, colorful, happy place. Creative activities and puzzles give immediate and continuous rewards throughout the entire city. Multiple challenges must be found and accepted, which can guide the player through to the next level – the destination and objective for one challenge can be the starting point of the next. Successful completion of challenges earns rewards such as points, time, environmental improvements, additional challenges, and liberating zones. An intricate single player campaign, as well as a multiplayer experience that supports two to four competitors via split screen. Sprint challenges – short bursts of gameplay where the player attempts to accomplish a single skill-based objective. Replay sprint levels to earn higher achievement ratings, which enable the gamer to unlock additional content from the Art Gallery. [THQ]</value>

      <value>PES 2010 focuses on enhancing the excitement of matches between players, making for a truly challenging experience that constantly tests the player. Intuitive zonal defending covers spaces and players need to look constantly for new ways to attack. PES 2010 focuses on being a real soccer simulation, as it requires both strategic play and quick reactions, as in real life. In addition to key out-field elements, goalkeepers are more versatile and with abilities matching those of modern shot-stoppers. The game's referees have also been reworked, with smarter AI elements allowing them to make more balanced calls during matches. PES 2010 has undergone a major visual revamp, with its celebrated player likenesses and animations now even closer to those of real-life players - including live player expressions to be depicted with an improved lighting system which differentiates between various conditions!

      <value>Mario Kart Wii comes with the intuitive Wii Wheel, which makes it easy for novices to compete against veterans, so no one is left in the dust. And with a broadband hookup to Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, players can compete with up to 11 other drivers from around the world for racing dominance. The game includes 16 new courses and 16 classic courses from previous Mario Kart games. For the first time ever, players have the option of racing with either karts or motorbikes. Players can also hit the road as their personalized Mii caricatures in addition to the handful of classic Nintendo characters found in the game. True to the series, the game features tons of racing, plenty of power-ups and oodles of objects for players to use to slow down other drivers. And 10 battle arenas keep players busy between trips around the circuit. Mario Kart Wii supports four different control options: Wii Remote with or without the Wii Wheel, Wii Remote and Nunchuk controller combo, Classic Controller and even the Nintendo GameCube controller. So there's bound to be a configuration that fits everyone's style. Mario Kart Wii launches with a new channel added to the Wii Menu to enhance game play: The Mario Kart Wii Channel. This new channel builds on the online community of Wii owners and lets players compete in tournaments, check worldwide rankings, see when their friends are playing and download ghost data.

      <value>Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection faithfully recreates eight of the most memorable tables from the golden age of pinball in photorealistic 3D. Working closely with Williams to ensure authenticity of each of the games, the collection is highlighted by some of the most popular and innovative Williams pinball tables, including Gorgar, the first-ever talking pinball machine, Black Knight, which introduced "Magna-Save" and Bonus Ball, and Space Shuttle, which took the pinball industry by storm in 1984. Every table has been meticulously recreated to bring players the visuals, sound effects and gameplay that made these games legendary successes. Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection harkens back to the arcades of the 1980s. Players begin Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection with access to four pinball tables, and the remaining four tables are unlocked as the game progresses. Players can spend as little as two minutes on a quick pinball challenge, or delve deeper into the game, gaining rewards in a token-based system as they unlock each of the pinball tables. Single-player Arcade and Challenge modes provide hours of solo entertainment, and a Multiplayer mode lets players face each other head-on. [Crave Entertainment]</value>

Dead Space Extraction marries the innovative motion controls of the Wii Remote with a frenetic first person perspective to create a new action-packed horror experience. Dead Space Extraction tells the story of a handful of space colonists desperately struggling to escape from a horrific infection on the Aegis VII mining colony deep in the furthest regions of space. The game introduces a new heroine to the fiction and as the crew fall victim to a mysterious contagion aboard the ship, it becomes clear that protecting her may be their only hope for survival. Dead Space Extraction introduces all new characters, weapons, enemies, puzzles and co-operative multiplayer gameplay. [Electronic Arts]</value>

      <value>PES 2008 has been redesigned to make incredible use of the motion-sensitive nature of the Wii's control system. The player has more control over the on-screen action than ever before, and in line with such advances, Konami has also unveiled an all-new pack design that conveys the unique in-game visuals and ease of use while maximising its use of cover stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Michael Owen. Crucial to PES 2008 for Wii is an all-new control system that truly elevates the level of control available to the player while retaining the depth and intuitive moves of the series. Making use of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, the player must also consider the movements of their teammates around them. The Nunchuck is used to move the current player, while the Wii Remote is used to pick out players to send them on runs or to receive passes via simple click and drag system which uses arrows to show the path of the run, and a press of the 'B' button to complete the move.

      <value>Utilizing the Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare engine, Call of Duty: World at War throws out the rulebook of war to transform WWII combat through a new enemy, new tactics and an uncensored experience of the climatic battles that gripped a generation. As U.S. Marines and Russian soldiers, players employ new features like cooperative gameplay, and weapons such as the flamethrower in the most chaotic and cinematically intense experience to date. Call of Duty: World at War introduces co-operative play, bringing fresh meaning to the "No One Fights Alone" mantra with up to four-players online for Xbox 360, PS3 and PC, or two-player local split-screen on consoles. Nintendo Wii will also support a unique co-op mode for two players. For the first time ever players can experience harrowing single-player missions together for greater camaraderie and tactical execution.  The co-op campaign allows players to rank up and unlock perks in competitive multiplayer by completing challenges and earning experience points, adding continuous re-playability and team-based gameplay. Whether playing competitively or cooperatively – if players are online with Call of Duty: World at War – they always gain experience points. Based on a player’s experience rank and rank of the player's friends, Call of Duty: World at War scales dynamically to provide a deeper level of challenge. [Activision]</value>

      <value>Wario and his pals learn fun, wacky moves after discovering a strange book and a mystical device called the Form Baton. Familiar characters from the WarioWare universe will return to this installment and some new ones will appear. Players must clear fast-paced sets of microgames, changing the way they hold the Wii Remote each time. As they do, they'll unlock more microgames and souvenirs. The WarioWare team took an idea so wacky, it could only be made with the latest technology ... the Wii Remote. WarioWare is back with a whole new set of moves. When Wario stumbles upon a strange device called a Form Baton, he and his friends use it to learn new moves that are as fun as they are wacky. With hundreds of microgames, this game is just as wild as you'd expect from the name WarioWare, but the game play has been revolutionized. Under Wario's tutelage, and with the help of the Wii Remote, players will swing, spin and squat their way to victory. With about 200 lightning-quick microgames and controls that range from scribbling to flailing, WarioWare: Smooth Moves takes interactive gaming to a whole new level. All players need is a Wii Remote and their best moves to be the champ. [Nintendo]</value>

Choose from the U.S. or European squad and participate in the various competition formats – foursomes where players hit alternate shots, fourballs and singles which traditionally bring the biennial event to a close with players going head to head. When playing The Ryder Cup mode offline, gamers have the option to swap matches, thus giving you the ultimate control over the outcomes of other matches. [Electronic Arts]</value>

      <value>[WiiWare] - (Also known as "Maboshi's Arcade")  This unique arcade action title features three games in one, based on three classic shapes: circle, bar and square. There are three game windows on screen at the same time, allowing for three people to play different games simultaneously. But there is a twist – each game impacts the other players. For every player, the goal is the same – score a million points – but the challenge is different, whether you’re bashing enemies in Circle Mode, weaving your way through Bar Mode, or burning through a maze of obstacles in Square Mode. MaBoShi: The Three Shape Arcade also features Mii characters, action replays that you can send to friends via WiiConnect24, and even a Nintendo DS download version for playing on the go.

      <value>The newest chapter of the Paper Mario story isn't just out of this world ... it's out of this dimension. What at first glance appears to be a 2-D sidescroller ripped straight from the pages of the Paper Mario universe soon turns into a 3-D action-adventure that defies all video game logic. Fusing 2-D and 3-D perspectives, not to mention RPG and platformer elements, the game slips back and forth between dimensions. The action sprawls across eight worlds filled with traps, puzzles, bizarre mysteries and items that often draw themselves out of thin air. Oh, and just because Mario's in the title doesn't mean he's the only star – players also get to play as Peach and Bowser. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>Capcom's popular and critically acclaimed ‘VS’ fighting series is getting an all new next-generation introduction. Tatsunoko vs. Capcom pits Capcom’s iconic characters against Tatsunoko Productions anime superheroes. This clash of heroes face off in two-on-two battles for the ultimate 2D tag-team battle. Originally released in Japanese arcades in the Fall of 2008, the original Tatsunoko vs. Capcom moved to the Wii console on December 11, 2008. This fighter blends these two rich universes by taking Capcom characters like Ryu from Street Fighter, Morrigan from Darkstalkers and the giant PTX-40A from Lost Planet and putting them against Tatsunoko fan-favorite characters from Gatchaman, Hurricane Polymar, Casshern and more. It’s a battler oyale that delivers match-ups that only exist in fans wildest dreams! Unlike the more well-known six-button layout that the Street Fighter franchise pioneered, the VS line features a simplified four button system: Weak, Medium, Strong and Assist for the tag-team option of. The Assist feature adds another compelling element found Capcom’s other VS series: allowing players to switch their character on the fly or call for help from their tag-team partner, allowing for spectacular super moves (Hyper Variable Combination). Successful execution of the Assist feature can turn the tide of battle on a dime. Historically the VS series excels in integrating the tag-team options by including customized moves like Variable Assist, Snapback, and the previously mentioned Hyper Variable combination that lets both characters on one team perform their Hyper attack. TvC enhances the above gameplay with new mechanics, including the Variable Aerial Rave that allows characters to be switched in the middle of an Aerial rave. More moves include the offensive Assault and defensive maneuver Mega Crash. Another new gameplay mechanic, titled Baroque, illuminates the character in a rainbow of colors, cancels the current attack and extends combos and damage. Featuring a robust line-up of characters, the console version added four mini-games and optional control schemes. [Capcom]</value>

      <value>One of the biggest names in boxing returns after a 15-year hiatus. Grab a Wii Remote controller in one hand and a Nunchuk controller in the other and step back into the ring with a modern update of the classic Punch-Out!! Little Mac is back! Everyone’s favorite underdog from the 1980s joins the best of the original Punch-Out!! cast in a modern re-imagination of the series. Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cel-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and back stories that capture all the fun and flair of the original Punch-Out!! games. The motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement. The motion-sensing Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers turn real-life swings into on-screen punches, so anyone can play. The game can also be played with classic NES-style controls by turning the Wii Remote sideways. Characters: Little Mac, Glass Joe, King Hippo, Doc Louis, Von Kaiser and other unannounced favorites. Special powers/weapons/moves/features: Players can obtain special "Star Punches," which allow Little Mac to take more Health from his rival in a single punch. Motion Control (Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers) Punch-Out!! uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuk to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch. Classic Control (Wii Remote NES style) Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has also included the option to play Punch-Out!! using the classic layout from the original NES controller. Use the 1 and 2 buttons along with the cross pad to throw hooks and jabs or to dodge. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>Guitar Hero World Tour marries Guitar Hero's guitar gameplay, with a cooperative band experience that combines the most advanced wireless instruments with revolutionary new online and offline gameplay modes. The game features a slick newly redesigned guitar, a genuine electronic drum kit and a microphone, as well as an innovative Music Studio music creator that lets players compose, record, edit and share their own rock and roll anthems, along with online Band Career and 8-player "Battle of the Bands." Guitar Hero World Tour is comprised entirely of master recordings from some of the greatest classic and modern rock bands of all-time including Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen, Linkin Park, The Eagles, Sublime and many more. Additionally, the game offers significantly more localized downloadable music than ever before on all of the next-generation consoles. Budding rock stars are also given creative license to fully customize everything from their characters’ appearance and instruments to their band’s logo and album covers. Featuring three drum pads, two raised cymbals and a bass kick pedal, the drum controller combines larger and quieter, velocity-sensitive drum heads with soft rubber construction to deliver authentic bounce back and is easy to set up, move, break down and store. Virtual musicians can live out their rock and roll fantasies by playing either a single instrument, or any combination of instruments, in addition to the full band experience. Guitar Hero World Tour introduces Battle of the Bands mode which allows eight players to join online and challenge each other band-to-band to determine who is the best of the best. In the Band modes, up to four players can jam together, online or off, as they progress through the game, and in single-player Career Mode, players can jam on any of the instruments in branching venue progression enabling them to rock out in the order of their choice. The game's Music Studio lets players express their musical creativity by giving them access to a full compliment of tools to create digital music from scratch, utilizing all of the instruments, and then play their compositions in the game.  Music creators can share their recordings with their friends online through GHTunes where other gamers can download their unique compositions and play them. [Activision]</value>

The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform - or might maike it tilt incorrectly just to mess with other players. New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote, and Mario’s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario. At the end of each stage during the coin battle multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on the number of coins they have collected. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>Little King's Story begins with the story of young boy named Corobo. Shy, and without many friends, Corobo stumbles upon a mysterious, powerful crown while walking in the forest near his village. He soon discovers that the crown grants him the ability to charm any person, and make them follow his orders. Suddenly, Howzer, the bull-knight, appears, informing Corobo that he is now King of the village, and he must not take this responsibility lightly. Returning to his sleepy village, as a King instead of a shy little boy, Corobo begins a quest to turn his small hamlet into a noble, fantastic kingdom. The storyline, visual look, and lyrical music of Little King's Story, work in concert to transport players to an interactive, enchanting, fairy tale world. By combining gameplay elements from life-simulation, real-time strategy, and adventure genres, the many aspects of creating a vast kingdom come to life! As King, players manage and involve their townspeople in the goals of creating this new territory; enlist them to dig for treasure, build new buildings and otherwise better their community. Of course, leadership is a two way street, so as King, players will try to conquer rival nations to create a single unified kingdom, as well as grant the requests of townspeople at whim. With the Wii Remote as a royal scepter, Little King’s Story allows players the chance to be the best king in the world. [XSEED Games]</value>

      <value>The game represents the first time fans will be able to experience The Beatles’ musical career for themselves. From the early touring days in 1963 Liverpool to the immortal, final performance on the Apple Corps rooftop, fans can follow in the band’s footsteps as they traverse the globe during the height of Beatlemania. Adding to the experience is the introduction of three-part vocal harmonies to game play, allowing gamers to revel in the unparalleled vocal stylings of the Fab Four. Beatles fans will also be thrilled to hear previously unreleased authentic voice recordings from John, Paul, George and Ringo chatting between takes during studio sessions recorded at Abbey Road more than four decades ago. The game begins during the band's earliest days at The Cavern Club in Liverpool, England. Gamers then travel across the Atlantic to experience the band's unforgettable 1964 performance on The Ed Sullivan Show, the sold-out concert at New York’s Shea Stadium in 1965, and conclude at The Beatles’ memorable concert at Budokan in Tokyo, Japan in 1966. The Beatles' studio years come to life in legendary Studio 2 at Abbey Road Studios. Highlighting the studio years are inspired artistic visual expressions known as Dreamscapes, intended to transport players to imaginative environments that capture the essence of The Beatles’ genre-busting musical and fashion transformations during their later years. The game follows The Beatles to 1969 where story mode culminates with their final performance on the rooftop of the Apple Corps Headquarters. The Beatles: Rock Band offers a new set of hardware representing the instruments made famous by John, Paul, George and Ringo. Featured in the set are the Rickenbacker 325 and Gretsch Duo Jet guitars - hailed as two of the celebrated, signature instruments played by John Lennon and George Harrison throughout their careers. Also included is a Höfner bass controller - a large-scale version of the bass famously used by Sir Paul McCartney. Rounding out the set is a Ringo Starr inspired, Ludwig-branded Rock Band 2 drum set with a classic pearl finish and vintage remake of a Beatles kick drum head. [MTV Games]</value>

Players control Samus by moving with the Nunchuk controller and aiming with the pointer, allowing for a level of immersion unlike anything they have ever experienced. Through the eyes of Samus, players experience a quantum leap in first-person control as they wield the Wii Remote, the ultimate device for the first-person shooter genre. Samus employs well-known power-ups like the Grapple Beam and Morph Ball, as well as a bunch of new surprises, to help her survive her coming trials. Saving the planets from Corruption isn't enough, though. Eventually, players must take down Samus' mortal enemy, Dark Samus. [Nintendo]</value>

      <value>[Metacritic's 2007 Wii Game of the Year] The ultimate Nintendo hero is taking the ultimate step ... out into space. Join Mario as he ushers in a new era of video games, defying gravity across all the planets in the galaxy. When some creature escapes into space with Princess Peach, Mario gives chase, exploring bizarre planets all across the galaxy. Mario, Peach and enemies new and old are here. Players run, jump and battle enemies as they explore all the planets in the galaxy. Since this game makes full use of all the features of the Wii Remote, players have to do all kinds of things to succeed: pressing buttons, swinging the Wii Remote and the Nunchuk, and even pointing at and dragging things with the pointer. Since he's in space, Mario can perform mind-bending jumps unlike anything he's done before. He'll also have a wealth of new moves that are all based around tilting, pointing and shaking the Wii Remote. Shake, tilt and point! Mario takes advantage of all the unique aspects of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controller, unleashing new moves as players shake the controller and even point at and drag items with the pointer.

      <value>A compilation including enhanced versions of "Power Stone" and "Power Stone 2," both originally released for the Sega Dreamcast and arcades. These fast and furious 3D brawlers put a new spin on "last man standing" as characters take each other on in frenzied match ups amidst fully interactive environments. Utilizing a simple control scheme, players can execute standard moves such as punches and kicks but the deeper power struggle comes in the form of "power stones." Fighters vie to collect these gems in order to tip the scales in their favor, as nabbing three will allow them to transform into super fighters that can perform devastating power moves. In addition, a variety of zany weapons and the ability to use environments in creative ways allow an incredible level of freedom and depth beyond the typical fighting game. Multiplayer support via the PSP system's ad hoc mode raises the stakes as friends duke it out in frenzied no holds barred battles. [Capcom]</value>

Her death unleashes the Sands of Time, which strike the Prince and threaten to destroy everything he holds dear.

      <value>Out to avenge the assassination of his father, Chili Con Carnage hurls Ramiro Cruz deep into the seedy underworld of Los Toros, Mexico, where he must single handedly create maximum carnage throughout the inner circles of local kingpin, Cesar Morales’ drug cartel. Featuring non-stop, over-the-top action, Ramiro comes equipped with a vast arsenal of weaponry along with signature super-spicy, gravity-defying special moves. Engage in gun frenzies against comical fiends such as mustached mercenaries, mutated super-Mamas and even killer exploding chickens. The action frenzy remains intense across seven unique 3D exotic locations from the trenches of a drug city to the heart of a dense jungle – an extensive varied landscape for a portable title. Three difficulty settings make the game appeal to casual shoot-em-up gamers as well as the most hardcore battle strategists, and the wireless multiplayer features of the PSP ensure that the game is enjoyable as a single player experience as well as a fun party game.

      <value>Controlling an army of lemmings, the aim is to get as many of these cute characters as you can from the entrance point to the exit point of a level within a time limit. Easy to learn, difficult to master; Lemmings is a test of strategy and fast thinking as you make 'on the spot', life or death decisions for your band of trusting little creatures. Use the unique skills of your Lemmings team to overcome the hazards ahead: The 'Bomber' explodes at will, the 'Floater' can survive high falls and the 'Basher' digs horizontally just when you need it. The 'Climber' is at hand for those tricky mountain ranges, the 'Blocker' creates an obstacle in the path ahead and the 'Builder' is there to construct walkways for his friends. Stretch your strategies across 100 plus levels as you lead your lemmings across an immense variety of challenging backdrops. The levels are arranged into five striking themes, each with its own unique visual flavour. So, whether it's going underground into the sewers or marching through fields and forests, the lemmings always have new terrain to explore. [SCEE]</value>

      <value>On a day that starts out like any other, an 11-year-old boy's life is changed forever. As the main character and his friend Miki pass a leisurely afternoon, Miki suddenly collapses from an unknown illness. When the girl shows no sign of waking, the main character grows distraught over not being a better friend and not having the means to save her. Suddenly, a strange voice offers him a second chance: "Beyond the door you can change your destiny!" He soon leaves the real world and journeys to the world of Vision, where, as a novice "Traveler," he will surmount myriad ordeals in hopes of ultimately meeting with the Goddess of Fortune to have a single wish granted. The would-be hero quickly makes friends both strange and fascinating as he finds himself blossoming into a successful Traveler. His courage and resolve are tested time and again as he and his newfound companions travel the mysterious lands of Vision. The challenges he faces are daunting, but his growing sense of self and responsibility propel him ever forward. Valuable friendships, unbounded courage, and his own personal growth will all prove indispensable as he seeks out his destiny: a life-changing adventure and the discovery of a hero inside an ordinary kid.

      <value>LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures takes the fun and creative construction of LEGO and combines it with the wits, daring and non-stop action from the original cinematic adventures that enthralled audiences everywhere (Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade). With a unique tongue-in-cheek take on the original adventures, LEGO Indiana Jones follows Dr. Jones escapades through the jungles of South America to the mountaintops of India. Fans can build, battle and brawl their way through their favorite cinematic moments, from Indy's entanglements with snakes to his dashing boulder run. Pop culture's most iconic archeologist whips through all the classic moments with the help of a host of supporting characters including Marion Ravenwood and Short Round. Players can also mix and match the body parts of more than 60 playable characters to create new heroes just as they could in the LEGO Star Wars games. [LucasArts]</value>

      <value>(Also known as "Guilty Gear X2 # Reload"  It has been a week since the world has heard from the small Eastern European kingdom of Villtania. As scattered reports from the Villtanian refugees who have fled the country dribble in, the world is hearing a horror-filled tale of devastation by monsters and biogeocenosis experiments summoned for war and world domination by Villtania's leading scholar, and self-described sorcerer, Raimond. The once beautiful Villtanian countryside now runs red with the blood of its people. The United Nations have declared an international emergency and while unable to commit any of the world's armies to this strange, supernatural conflict, they have offered a huge reward to any hot-shot mercenaries or hunters brave enough to take on theses monsters from another dimension and restore order to Villtania. Warriors from around the world, some for the sake of justice, others for money, have stood up and gathered in the Villtanian battle field. Now, a new war has begun.</value>

      <value>Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection faithfully recreates eight of the most memorable tables from the golden age of pinball in photorealistic 3D. Working closely with Williams to ensure authenticity of each of the games, the collection is highlighted by some of the most popular and innovative Williams pinball tables, including Gorgar, the first-ever talking pinball machine, Black Knight, which introduced "Magna-Save" and Bonus Ball, and Space Shuttle, which took the pinball industry by storm in 1984. Every table has been meticulously recreated to bring players the visuals, sound effects and gameplay that made these games legendary successes. Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection harkens back to the arcades of the 1980s. Players begin Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection with access to four pinball tables, and the remaining four tables are unlocked as the game progresses. Players can spend as little as two minutes on a quick pinball challenge, or delve deeper into the game, gaining rewards in a token-based system as they unlock each of the pinball tables. Single-player Arcade and Challenge modes provide hours of solo entertainment, and a Multiplayer mode lets players face each other head-on. [Crave Entertainment]</value>

      <value>The rumor going around St. Hermelin High School holds that if you play the "Persona" game, you can see what the future holds for you. When a group of students-some eager, some skeptical-tries the game out, they experience something quite different. Before long, the city is turned upside-down and demons are roaming the streets, and only the students' newfound power of Persona can set things right again. Whether you pursue Takahisa Kandori and his abuses of the power he wields as SEBEC's president, or whether you delve into the curse of the Snow Queen that has plagued St. Hermelin for decades, a deep, modern, psychological tale awaits. Remember your true self, and free the tortured psyches of others... More than the same old JRPG -- Dark, philosophical, and complex, Persona sets you up in a modern day Japan that has gone into chaos.  Demons run free, and you and your team must navigate corruption, mental frailty, and an alternate version of your world to bring your reality back into order. A second chance on PSP -- Offering a second opportunity to experience the beginnings of the acclaimed Persona series, this remake boasts a fully relocalized script, revamped user interface, faster battles, expanded soundtrack, and new in-game movies with voice work added just for the North American release. Unique tactical opportunities -- The inner selves known Personas are your key to progressing through the adventure, adding skills and incredible depth to your battle tactics. Expand and improve your collection through the Demon Negotiation system that offers spell cards that you can later fuse into new Personas. [Atlus USA]</value>

      <value>Mega Man Maverick Hunter X is a remake of the original Mega Man X title that first appeared on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The game builds upon the original, adding newly rendered 3D character models, totally new environments and gameplay features that raise the bar for side-scrolling platformers. Mega Man Maverick Hunter X also includes an animated movie that provides real insight into the Mega Man X universe and even gives gamers a sneak peek at events that took place before the plot line of the first game. Plus to ensure that even the most veteran of gamers is given a real challenge, the level arrangements have been modified; with item locations, map layouts and the strategies needed for completing levels all updated. The year is 21XX. A mysterious robot named X has become the model from which further robots, called Reploids, were created to aid mankind. Unfortunately, some of the Reploids turned against the humans and were given the name Mavericks. In response to this, the Maverick Hunters, an elite squad of Reploids, was formed to combat these renegade Reploids and calm was restored until one of the Maverick Hunters, a powerful Reploid named Sigma, turned against the peacekeepers. Now X and his fellow Maverick Hunter friend, Zero, must prevent Sigma from executing his evil plans to destroy humanity. [Capcom]</value>

      <value>You are a ninja in N+. Your god-like speed, dexterity, jumping power, and reflexes are all the result of an amazingly fast metabolism; sadly, so is your natural lifespan of 1.5 minutes. Like all Ninjas, you have an unquenchable thirst for gold and a natural propensity for exploring rooms infested by increasingly lethal Ninja-killing robots. N emphasizes pacifism, humility, and the need to traverse 5 rooms before the end of your lifetime; a feat known only as ‘beating an episode’. In accordance with the teachings of N, it is your profound hope that one day you will develop your platforming skills, intelligence, and inexplicable ability to reincarnate to achieve total mastery of all 300 levels.

      <value>MotorStorm's next mission is battling the frozen wasteland of Alaska's Arctic Edge. MotorStorm Arctic Edge delivers brutal off-road racing in the beautiful yet lethal and unpredictable setting of Alaska. With temperatures plummeting, sudden avalanches, broken ice bridges, and three different racing altitudes, Arcitc Edge is the most inhospitable environment in the franchise's history. In addition to the six vehicle classes from the original MotorStorm, two new vehicles (the Snowcat and Snow Machine) have been introduced to combat the ice, the cold and the snow. One has the power and size to blast through packed snow, while the other has the grip and pace to combat most of what the sub-zero conditions can throw at it. MotorStorm Arctic Edge is fit for single player action, online multiplayer or playing with friends; two to eight players can compete against each other wirelessly via Ad Hoc Mode on PSP. Alternatively, you can also compete via online multiplayer using Infrastructure Mode on PSP to make it to the summit of the online global leaderboards.</value>

      <value>The kingdom of Altago is rebuilding their kingdom around a newfound peace after years of war against the merciless armies of Romn. The classic adventuresome duo, Adol and Dogi, arrive in the harbor of Altago City, and quickly find themselves in a scuffle with the Dragon Knights, the kingdom's military police body, when attempting to save a local girl from harassment by one of their commanding officers. Upset by the interruption and subsequent humiliation, the commander arrests Adol and Dogi, charging them with espionage. The king of Altago, having known of the duo's pending arrival from an old trusted friend, quickly releases the pair from prison and summons them to his chambers. He tells the men about an ancient shrine that was uncovered after a recent earthquake, and asks for their help in investigating this mysterious new find. Adol and Dogi oblige, unaware that they are about to take the first steps on a long journey to save all of Altago from long-forgotten ancient forces, and to reunite the estranged five tribes who serve and protect the Five Great Dragons – deified beings who may well be the world's last hope. Ys SEVEN is the latest installment in the long-running Ys series which first debuted on PC in 1987. This is the first iteration to be built specifically for the PSP system, taking full advantage of the widescreen format and hardware. The battle system consists of a three-member battle party with enemies engaged on the field map in real-time for fast-paced combat. Old fans of the series and new players alike will be immersed into the rich vibrant world containing over 30 hours of gameplay. </value>

      <value>PES 2008 features a brand new intelligence system, called Teamvision, that adapts and reacts to players own gameplay styles to ensure that the computer controlled opponents are always challenging and forcing the player to think and chance their style of play to avoid being out-thought by the game. It learns counter attacks that target your weaknesses and look to exploit any repetitive tactics players use. Defenders react better to danger, closing down the ball and charging at shots and the goalkeepers hold shots that are closer to them as well. Teammates make more intelligent runs into space and the close control has been sharpened to ensure quick and fluid passing and speedy attacks can be built. The next gen versions also feature extensive edit modes so players can completely customise their PES 2008 experience. [Konami]</value>

      <value>The 2D Adventures of Rotating Octopus Character is a twitchy, fast paced platform game which you control with just two buttons. Rotating Octopus Character can't stop spinning, and he sticks to everything, but he can change direction, and he can jump. So, armed with those two moves - Reverse, and Jump - you're tasked with helping ROC to collect all the baby octopi who have been so unfortunately scattered all over the world. The videogame world is full of hazards for a spinning octopus, too, so it's not just a case of jump-and-grab. Timing is everything to avoid sending ROC hurtling to his doom. </value>

      <value>Coconut Dodge features two modes of play. The default mode is ideal for casual players interested in a quick and fun "game-on-the-go"; the Maze Master mode is primarily targeted at the hardcore audience willing to explore each level to its fullest by applying strategy, wits, and perseverance on a quest to reach a specific number of points before the end of each level. In this mode there is a specific pattern of movement that can be memorized and mastered with enough experience and quick thinking, and this is where Coconut Dodge really excels: beneath its visually simple faÃ§ade is a hard nut to crack as the game is loaded with addicting and varied gameplay.  The in-game tutorial is highly recommended to all audiences as it explains the various Power-Ups and their use within the game.</value>

      <value>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance is an action/RPG that features the largest roster of comic book characters ever seen in a video game.  Players assume the roles of more than 20 Marvel Super Heroes including Spider-Man, Wolverine, Blade and Captain America, and through their actions determine the fate of both planet Earth and the Marvel universe – revealed in one of multiple epilogues. Marvel: Ultimate Alliance offers total team customization, where players create their own team name, icon and vehicle, as well as establish their team reputation as they play throughout the story.  Gamers also have the option to level up each character individually to their liking, or all team members at the same time to keep their heroes balanced.  With the game's new combat system, players battle against the world's most notorious Marvel Super Villains in the air, underwater, and on the ground, using grappling, blocking and dodging moves, by charging up their Super Hero powers before unleashing them, and using environmental objects as one and two-handed weapons. Marvel:  Ultimate Alliance features a storyline where the missions players accept, the objectives they complete, and their interactions with other characters throughout the game directly impact how the story plays out. The game also features a robust multiplayer component where fans can band together with friends as their favorite Marvel Super Heroes, and fight evil in both on and offline cooperative story modes.  There's also a Competitive Mode where the game tracks various in-game stats so players can see how well they stack up against one another – affecting the amount of experience points earned and how equipment is distributed.

      <value>PES 6 once again features the graphical and gameplay tweaks that enable each new title to play completely differently from previous incarnations. The shooting system has been the subject of extensive retouching, now enabling players to pull off much more accurate snap shots as well as being able to exert a much larger feeling of control when going for quick half volleys or difficult full volleys. The intelligence of players has seen a marked improvement. For example, players now make more realistic runs into space, often pointing where they would like the ball played. The physical aspect has also been beefed up, with strikers using their sheer presence to turn defenders and likewise, the defenders stepping a yard away to enable them to force players away from goal and not letting them spin into dangerous positions. PES 6 also has a number of new teams licensed for inclusion, with the International roster now featuring the official kits for Argentina, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Sweden. New gameplay modes have been added and features like the much loved Master League mode also returns, together with a host of new tricks, feints and animations that can be used to bamboozle your opposition.

      <value>Lumines II is the sequel to the extremely addictive puzzle-based video game, Lumines. Gamers control squares made of four smaller block pieces that are dropped into the playing field one at a time to form same-color squares.  The vertical "timeline" sweeps across the playing field from left to right and wipes the same-color squares from the playing field.  Unmatched blocks pile up, and the game ends when the pile gets to the top of the playing screen.  Advance through many action-packed levels, each with its own musical theme and sound effects.

        On the pitch, critical gameplay fundamentals have been enhanced to ensure that FIFA Soccer 10 mirrors real-world soccer, providing more sophisticated ball control, and physical interaction between players. In addition, players now move, behave and position themselves more realistically. On attack, players analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. On defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. Plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better-urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in FIFA Soccer 10. In goal, a myriad of improvements and refinements to goalkeeper intelligence result in a more responsive and powerful rushing system and ultra-realistic saves. Better balance on lofted through balls, improved goalkeeper intelligence, more realistic shooting mechanics with less shots hitting the goal posts, a practice arena to perfect skills, and a more immersive soccer experience through continuous play and quick free kicks are just a few of the issues raised by fans and addressed in FIFA Soccer 10. Three new innovations revealed today at E3 have been developed to change the player control experience in FIFA Soccer 10. The first-ever true 360 degree dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.
      </value>
      <value>FIFA Soccer 10 also features a deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode with more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves. [Electronic Arts]</value>

Adding to the online feature set, which includes customizable Online League Play with up to 30 teams, scrolling MLB Score Ticker and more, MLB 08 The Show introduces SCOUT (SportsConnect Online User Tracking), which allows gamers to set and store their game preferences on the MLB server, and enables the system to look for a Quick Match with opponents that fits similar competitive criteria.

      <value>Unique to its genre, Crush introduces a valuable new puzzle gaming experience that is wholly suited to the PSP system. Set within a complex, hypnotic 3D world, players use the game's unique crush mechanic to "crush" the environment and transform it into a more simplified 2D platformer. Once flattened, players utilize the 2D space to move to new areas to solve otherwise impossible challenges, and unlock secret items that were previously unobtainable in the 3D environment. Players then "uncrush" the 2D environment and return to the 3D world. Designed for a wide and varied audience, Crush tells the story of Dan, a man with a lifetime of unresolved issues and bottled up emotions that has turned him into a nervous insomniac who is too tired to turn his life around. Desperate for a cure, he turns to hypnosis. It is during this state that he is given one last chance to sort through the wreckage of his past, before he loses the last thing he has – his sanity.

      <value>LEGO Star Wars II takes the fun and customization ability of the LEGO play pattern and combines it with the epic story, characters and action from the revolutionary Star Wars: Episodes IV, V and VI. With a unique tongue-in-cheek take on the Original Trilogy, LEGO Star Wars II lets you build and battle your way through your favorite film moments. From Darth Vader's pursuit of Princess Leia aboard her Blockade Runner to Luke's final confrontation with Emperor Palpatine. For the first time ever, characters can get in and out of vehicles, as well as ride creatures. Because it's LEGO style, you can also mix and match the body parts of more than 50 playable characters to create one of millions of possible LEGO Star Wars heroes. And on PS2, Xbox and Windows platforms, a game save from the first LEGO Star Wars can unlock another 50-plus additional characters for Free Play mode -- that's more than 100 total characters. Other exciting additions include free-roaming vehicle levels, the ability to switch ships at will in Free Play mode, cool new character-specific attacks and maneuvers, playable mini-kit vehicles, an adaptive difficulty option and more.

Gabe finds himself dealing with a beautiful woman from his past who harbors a shocking secret while he battles the Red Section, a para-military group in possession of Project Dark Mirror, a next-generation weapon of mass destruction. Using Precision Strike Tactics, advanced vision technology, and the latest in high-tech weaponry, Logan and his team perform surgical strike missions - too sensitive for a military response, too dangerous for civilian intelligence forces.

      <value>The Jeanne d'Arc story begins far in the past, when a great war was waged by mankind against demonic armies attempting to invade the human world. During that time, five brave heroes created armlets to restrain the demon gods. In a quest to turn back the rueful army, a young crusader named Jeanne is commanded by mysterious voices to use the power of the magical armlet to seal away the demon king and recover her homeland once and for all. Set among sprawling fields, battle-torn villages, and intricate dungeons, Jeanne d'Arc unfolds through more than 40 expansive and highly detailed environments, where players will engage in the pursuit of France's resurgence. Players control up to 14 characters throughout the journey, including humans and beasts, as they battle a variety of enemies in the quest to turn back the English domination. Jeanne d'Arc delivers a strategic, turn-based battle system where players engage in unique team attacks and defensive schemes, using multiple characters' skills in combination to create devastating strikes. Further adding to the depth of play, each character has access to one of eight weapon types that are also upgradeable as players' progress through the game. Additionally, players can customize their characters with more than 150 different skills and abilities throughout the game. [SCEA]</value>

      <value>Baten Kaitos Origins takes place 20 years before the first Baten Kaitos game. It explains how the diabolical Emperor Geldoblame rose to power, and it also fills in many details about the heroes from the first title. In addition, players will learn about the origins of the world itself and why the Lost Ocean is returning. The hero, a blue-haired young man named Sagi, was sent to assassinate the Emperor but found the job had been done for him. Blamed for the death, he's now on the run with two friends - a robot named Guillo and a young woman named Milly. In the initial stages, the player's party will progress in a linear fashion, moving from one area to the next along a set path. After playing the game for a few hours, players will acquire a ship that lets them visit areas in the order of their choosing, allowing them to either pursue optional side quests or blast through the main mission as they see fit. Unlike traditional RPGs, where characters gain levels in categories such as strength and agility, the majority of leveling-up occurs by procuring better Magnus cards. There are more than 600 different Magnus cards in Baten Kaitos Origins, some of which have truly fantastical properties. Players can acquire cards in many different ways, including trading, buying, winning as spoils of war or by creating them themselves.</value>

The lead player, viewing the entire maze on the Game Boy Advance, must avoid the other three players controlling the ghosts on the television screen. To raise the tension factor, the three ghost players can only see part of the maze around their characters. Pac-Man must clear all the pac-dots in each maze to progress to the next level. </value>

      <value>Picture flying through rugged terrain performing massive jumps at more than 70 mph, hitting a 40-foot jump at the ledge of a 200-foot cliff, and pulling off a backflip, a Tsunami, and a 360 all before you land. In Freekstyle, you can perform these tricks on nine different tracks. Choose from any of eight different riders with their own unique attitude and style, and then fly high in Circuit, Race, Freestyle, and Freeride game modes. If this sounds like your idea of a good time, then you're ready for the extreme lifestyle of motoX racing.</value>

      <value>Lego Star Wars II takes the fun and customization ability of the LEGO play pattern and combines it with the epic story, characters and action from the revolutionary Star Wars: Episodes IV, V and VI. With a unique tongue-in-cheek take on the Original Trilogy, LEGO Star Wars II lets you build and battle your way through your favorite film moments. From Darth Vader's pursuit of Princess Leia aboard her Blockade Runner to Luke's final confrontation with Emperor Palpatine. For the first time ever, characters can get in and out of vehicles, as well as ride creatures. Because it's LEGO style, you can also mix and match the body parts of more than 50 playable characters to create one of millions of possible LEGO Star Wars heroes. And on PS2, Xbox and Windows platforms, a game save from the first LEGO Star Wars can unlock another 50-plus additional characters for Free Play mode -- that's more than 100 total characters. Other exciting additions include free-roaming vehicle levels, the ability to switch ships at will in Free Play mode, cool new character-specific attacks and maneuvers, playable mini-kit vehicles, an adaptive difficulty option and more.</value>

      <value>Dr. Mario requires equal parts strategy and speed to achieve victory. Delete viruses by throwing vitamin capsules into a bottle. Since many viruses are trapped at the bottom of the bottle, you must plan ahead in order to eliminate them.In Puzzle League, you'll form a chain of three or more same-colored blocks. When you match up shapes, the blocks on top will fall onto other matching blocks, but if you can't make a match, the blocks rise to the top of the screen. This game also has unusual depth in terms of options and settings which lets players create a custom game experience.</value>

The company he works for is going bankrupt, so to save it, Olimar must salvage the treasure buried all over the planet.

      <value>In this ninth entry in the Legend of Zelda series, Link debuts on GameCube with a fun new cel-shaded look, but the game stays true to the respected heritage of the series.

And for the very first time, Link sails freely on the high seas. Join Link on his most epic and scenic adventure yet. Face unimaginable monsters, explore puzzling dungeons, and meet a cast of unforgettable characters as he searches for his kidnapped sister, Aryll. </value>

      <value>Imagine, if you will, a berserk B-movie horror film producer with a twisted sense of humor who puts up a million bucks (fictitious, of course!) to anyone who can survive his 7 movie-themed worlds. It's a bloody mess of mutant monsters, over 1000 traps and items, and abject terror fused with B-movie humor. You must rely solely on the game's sensory feedback (eyesight, hearing, smell, sixth sense) and the hard-to-find "Horror Monitor" to survive the epic adventure! Illbleed delivers a badly needed transfusion to the "been there, done that" horror game genre.</value>

      <value>Ruled by a royal family said to be descendants of the gods themselves, Fantasinia is a prosperous and peaceful land -- until the peace is shattered by the invading forces of the Empire of Bronkia. Led by the young emperor Gulcasa, who seized control of the Empire in a brutal coup d?etat, Bronchia's Imperial Army cuts a bloody swath through the people of Fantasinia and the Royal Armies of King Ordeene. Amidst the chaos, a young woman escapes from the besieged capital of Partina -- a woman with innocence in her face, and a sword in her hand. The girl?s name is Princess Yggdra, the last surviving member of the royal family; the sword is the Gran Centurio, a legendary blade once wielded by the founder of Fantasinia, and passed down through generations of royalty. Fleeing to to a remote valley at the southern tip of the continent, Yggdra meets up with Milanor, the charismatic leader of a band of thieves, and readies herself for a war of liberation.</value>

      <value>It's a dark night. The cool, calming ocean air floats across your body, rejuvenating your animal spirit, flowing through your nerves like iced lightning. You breathe deeply, and climb into the cockpit of your P-51 Mustang. As you strap down your helmet and goggles you utter a silent prayer; you know that this time you launch off the carrier could be your last. So gear up, soldier. You're one of the best now...one of the Iron Aces.</value>

      <value>Matt Hoffman's Pro BMX 2 takes you for a ride through free-roaming cities, where you can perform a variety of stunts on your bike. Choose from an array of professional riders--including Matt Hoffman, Ruben Alcantara, Cory Nastazio, Mike Escamilla, Nathan Wessel, and Joe Kowalski--and begin a skating career. You'll travel to eight expansive cities that come to life with helicopters, boats, cars, and pedestrians. Then, challenge your friend in Push mode, where every time you score big, your side of the screen gets bigger while your friend's shrinks. </value>

First released for the original NES in 1988, Super Mario Bros. 2 makes its debut on the Game Boy Advance with new enemies, improved graphics, and tougher challenges.  Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad adventure through seven fantasy worlds on a quest to save the day, though they have little more than vegetables for defense.  New challenges include collecting red coins and finding Yoshi's hidden eggs.  </value>

There's lots of treasure in there for the taking, and I want it all. I'm sure there are gonna be all kinds of weird enemies and big, bad bosses in there, so if you don't think you can hack it, put the game down now.

Metroid: Zero Mission relives the story that started it all--revealing for the first time full details of her meeting with the Metroids.  The plotline will be familiar to longtime fans of the Metroid series, but the challenges are new, the power-ups are plentiful, and the graphics and sound are supercharged.  Plus, if you thought that the original Metroid had a surprise ending, wait until you get past the Mother Brain in Metroid: Zero Mission.  A new twist provides a deeper adventure than ever before.</value>

      <value>When Baby Mario falls from the sky, the big-hearted Yoshis vow to reunite him with his twin brother on the far side of the island.  It won't be easy, but you must help them take on a meddling Magikoopa and his entire cast of underhanded underlings.  Your journey spans the island's jungles, caves, and snowcapped peaks--each area filled with hidden rooms, secret passages, charming minigames, demented bosses, and all-new pals.  Sure, Yoshi looks cute, but he packs some pretty amazing firepower--he can throw eggs, hover, stomp, pound the ground, slurp up enemies, and morph into a toy submarine.  </value>

      <value>It's a new outbreak of Dr. Mario madness! Dr. Mario's back, packing a prescription for fun--and now the frenzied action of the original gets even more frantic with all-new multiplayer modes! Up to four players can go head-to-head, or they can pair up to pile on capsules in Team Battle. Other options let 'em race against time in Score Attack, target flashing viruses in Flash Mode, or test endurance in Marathon play. There's even a new story mode that pits Mario against pilferers trying to profit from his Megavitamins. It's a puzzling epidemic, and Dr. Mario's got the cure!</value>

      <value>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 redefined an already great game. Its addition of stellar new features (like Create-A-Park), and great game-play tweaks (the manual maneuver will be copied for years to come) made it the best installment in a killer series of games. Anyone who has ever skated the Philadelphia level will agree -- this game is a masterpiece of level design. Hell, it's a masterpiece all around. There isn't a bad park or dull moment, just pure gaming nirvana!</value>

Unless you're a fan of violence, foul language, and racy innuendo, you'd best steer clear of this one.</value>
